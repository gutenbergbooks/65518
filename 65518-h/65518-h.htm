</div>


<p class="noindent"><em>May it please the court</em>:</p>

<p class="noindent">When this book was conceived, it was intended to be titled
“U.S. v. the South: A Brief for the Defense,” but it seemed
a cumbersome title and the finished work is not, of course,
a brief for the South in any lawyer’s sense of the word. It is
no more than an extended personal essay, presented in this
form because the relationship that exists between the rest of
the country and the South, in the area of race relations,
often has the aspect of an adversary proceeding. We of the
South see ourselves on the defensive, and we frequently
find ourselves, as lawyers do, responding in terms of the
law and the evidence.</p>

<p>It is an unpleasant position for the South, which regards
itself as very much a part of the American Republic, and
it is an uncomfortable position also: We find ourselves
defending certain actions and attitudes that to much of the
country, and to much of the world, appear indefensible;
some times we are unsure just what it is we are defending,
or why we are defending it. We would like to think more
upon these questions, but in this conflict there seldom seems
to be time for thought or for understanding on either side.
When one side is crying “bigot!” and the other is yelling
“hypocrite!,” an invitation to sit down and reason together
is not likely to draw the most cordial response.</p>

<p>This brief for the South, as any brief must be, necessarily
is a partisan pleading. My thought is to present the South’s
case (with a few digressions, irrelevancies, reminiscences,
obscurities, and mean digs thrown in), but I hope to present
it fairly, and without those overtones of shrill partisanship
that drown out the voice of reason altogether. And it seems
to me, if the suggestion may be advanced with due modesty,
that a Virginia Conservative is perhaps in an unusually
advantageous position to write such a brief. By tradition,
inheritance, geography, and every intangible of the spirit,
Virginia is part of the South. The Old Dominion, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
is much closer to the “Old South” than, say, North Carolina
or Florida. Richmond was for four years the capital of a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i> nation, the Confederate States of America; to this
day, our children play soldier in the trenches and romp
happily on the breastworks left from the bloody conflict in
which the CSA were vanquished. The Confederacy, the War,
the legacy of Lee&mdash;these play a role in Virginia’s life that
continues to mystify, to entrance, sometimes to repel the
visitor to the State. Virginia’s “Southernness” reaches to the
bone and marrow of this metaphysical concept; and if
Virginia perhaps has exhibited more of the better and gentler
aspects of the South, and fewer of the meaner and more
violent aspects, we nevertheless have shared the best and
the worst with our sister States. On questions of race relations,
of school segregation, of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</i> tolerable
to black and white alike, Virginia’s views have been predominantly
the South’s views.</p>

<p>Yet it is evident, as this is written, that the immediate
battle over school segregation has passed Virginia by. The
Old Dominion no longer struggles in the arena; we watch
from the grandstand now. The desegregation of our public
schools has been accepted in principle; a State Pupil Placement
Board voluntarily has assigned hundreds of Negro
children to schools that formerly were white schools. In
our largest cities, most department-store dining facilities, in
theory at least, serve any customer who asks to be served.
Segregation has ended in transportation facilities, in libraries,
in parks, in most places of public assembly. Negroes register
and vote freely. It is true of Virginia, I believe, that the
more things change, the more they stay the same; down deep,
very little has changed. But by and large, Virginia has been
eliminated from the fight. I wrote one book about the South
a few years ago, when Virginia was still in the thick of it,
and I was on horse and the pen was a lance. The sidelines
offer a better perspective.</p>

<p>A word of definition is in order. When I speak in this
essay of “the South,” what I mean is the white South, and
more narrowly still, I mean the white adults of thirteen
States who continue to share, in general, an attitude on race
relations that has descended from attitudes of the “Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
South.” There is, of course, a Negro South, but it is mysterious
and incomprehensible to most white men. And there
is a Liberal South, comprising a large number of white persons
who oppose racial segregation in principle if they seldom
oppose it in daily practice. These groups have their own
able and articulate spokesmen; they have filed their own
briefs by the dozen. And it is simply to avoid interminable
qualifications&mdash;“most white Southerners feel,” or “the large
preponderance of opinion among white adults in thirteen
Southern States holds”&mdash;that I here define “the South” for
my own immediate purposes.</p>

<p>With those preliminary remarks, let me turn, if I may,
by slow degrees, to argument on the case at bar.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At the time of the Supreme Court’s opinion in <em>Brown</em> v.
<em>Board of Education</em>, on Monday, May 17, 1954, seventeen
Southern and border States maintained racially separate
schools. These included, in addition to the thirteen States to
be treated here as “the South,” the States of Maryland,
Delaware, Kansas, and Missouri, plus the District of Columbia.
Each of the five speedily abandoned segregation&mdash;Kansas
willingly, Missouri stoically, Maryland cheerlessly,
Delaware grudgingly. The District abandoned segregation;
white parents abandoned the District, and by 1962 an 82
per cent resegregation could be observed in the schools. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic
transit gloria</i> Monday. None of the four States was in any
real sense a part of the South; their constitutional or statutory
requirements for segregated schools were appendages more
or less ripe for the clipping. And though southern Missouri
and the Delaware shore submitted to desegregation with
some bitterness, the surgery was not especially painful and
the operations, on the whole, were uneventful.</p>

<p>This essay is concerned chiefly with the other thirteen
States, with attitudes and practices that then prevailed widely
in all of them and still prevail overwhelmingly in some of
them: the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. A possibly
more definitive list might eliminate Oklahoma and Kentucky
from this neo-Confederate fold; their Negro populations comprise
no more than 6 or 7 per cent of the State total, and
Oklahoma looks to the Southwest while Kentucky (mildly
anesthetized by Mr. Bingham’s Louisville <cite>Courier-Journal</cite>)
looks nowhere in particular. Yet I myself was reared in
Oklahoma, and I know at first hand of the intensely Southern
sentiment that still obtains in much of the State; my Kentucky
friends write me poignantly, as one writes from East Berlin
or Poland, asking CARE packages and seeking prayers, and
I judge that many Kentuckians continue to look upon integration
as they might look upon orange slices in a julep. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
will drink the horrid thing, but their sense of propriety is
outraged.</p>

<p>These thirteen States together make up a fascinating part
of the American Republic. Their combined area amounts to
nearly 863,000 square miles, or about 28 per cent of the
continental United States. The 1960 census found in them
48,802,000 persons, of whom 24,036,000 were males and
24,755,000 were females; and, more to our point, the census
found in them 38,404,000 white persons, 10,231,000 Negro
persons, and 167,000 other nonwhites, mostly Indians in
Texas, Oklahoma, and North Carolina.</p>

<p>The census of 1960 turned up a great many other figures
useful to an understanding of the American South. Some of
these are best presented in tabulated form. These figures, for
example, bear close study:</p>

<p>The Negro component within the American Union, it is
evident, remains today about what it has been all along.
Within the Southern States, the Negro population is dropping
steadily as a percentage of the whole. Negroes comprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
11.6 per cent of the nation’s total in population in 1900, 9.7
per cent in 1930, and 10.5 per cent in 1960. But this 10.5
per cent of 1960 has shifted dramatically across the nation.
Of 18,872,000 Negroes, 8,641,000 or 46 per cent, were living
in 1960 outside the thirteen States of the South. There were
more Negroes in New York City (1,227,000) than in all of
Mississippi or Alabama. Philadelphia turned up 26.4 per cent
Negro; Georgia is 28.5 per cent Negro. Chicago counted
almost as many Negroes in its city limits (813,000) as there
were in the whole of Virginia (816,000), and they represented
a larger part of the total&mdash;a concentrated 23 per cent
in Chicago, a scattered 21 per cent in Virginia.</p>

<p>Between 1950 and 1960, the Census Bureau has reported,
the South experienced a net out-migration of about 1,457,000
Negroes. The figure represents the number of Negroes that
census enumerators of 1960 would have expected to find in
the South if the Negro populations of 1950 had stayed put
and had experienced a normal increase of births over deaths.
Alabama, which should have gained 225,000 Negroes on this
basis, gained only 1000 in the decade; South Carolina, which
normally would have gained 226,000 Negroes, gained only
8000. Mississippi actually experienced a net loss in Negro
population, from 986,000 in 1950 to 915,000 in 1960.</p>

<p>Where did these Negro migrants go? To the North, primarily&mdash;more
than a million of them. Others went west: California
experienced a net in-migration of 354,000 Negroes.
Large numbers moved to Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan. The
migration was almost entirely to Northern cities, and ironically,
to urban societies of the North almost as segregated by
geography as the Old South is segregated by custom.</p>

<p>Yet for all the steady decline of Negro components in
Southern States, it still is true that the South, as a region,
houses the largest concentration of colored citizens. Of the
fifteen States that in 1960 had more than 500,000 Negro
residents, all but four (New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and
New Jersey) were in the South. The thirteen Southern States
that were 35 per cent Negro in 1900 were still 21 per cent
Negro in 1960, and in 140 Southern counties, white residents
in 1960 remained numerically in the minority.</p>

<p>These figures, as I hope to demonstrate after a while,
should be treated with some reserve, but on their own they
tell a revolutionary tale. Of the twelve States that were firmly
rural in 1940, only North and South Carolina, Kentucky,
Arkansas, and Mississippi were found predominantly rural in
1960. This migration from the countryside has seen the
number of farms in the South drop from 3,100,000 in 1910
to 1,650,000 in 1959; the number of farms either owned or
operated by Negroes has dropped from 890,000 to 272,000
in the same period.</p>

<p>In many aspects, to be sure, the census of 1960 found the
South hardly changed at all. The region still is composed
overwhelmingly of native-born Americans; except for Florida
and Texas, none of the thirteen States has as much as four-tenths
of 1 per cent foreign-born population. Southerners still
are moving out of the South more rapidly than non-Southerners
are moving in, but the Southern tendency to stay put
remains much in evidence: 90 per cent of the citizens of
Mississippi were born there, and the percentage is almost as
high in Alabama and the Carolinas.</p>

<p>In terms of material wealth, our people remain relatively
poor. Per capita incomes in 1959 ranged from $1162 in
Mississippi to $1980 in Florida, against a national average
of $2166. Wages in the thirteen States then averaged $73.31
weekly and $1.82 hourly, far below national averages of
$90.91 and $2.29. As one consequence, housing conditions
are sadly below par. The 1960 census found, in the country
as a whole, 18.8 per cent of all dwellings “dilapidated or lacking
plumbing facilities”; the percentages were 49.2 in Mississippi,
44.9 in Arkansas, and 41.2 in Kentucky; and no State
outside the South approached these poor ratings.</p>

<p>The picture is not entirely bleak. Poor as they are, the
Southern States in general are exerting a much greater effort
than their wealthier Northern sisters. Over the country as a
whole, State and local governments in 1959 raised $102.12
per capita from their own tax sources. Seven of the thirteen
Southern States were far above this average: Mississippi, for
example, raised $128.76 per capita from local sources, a
figure that compares with $108.92 in New York, $83.56 in
Connecticut, and $81.51 in Delaware. With much less to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
levy upon, the Southern States proportionately are pouring
more into their schools. And the outlook is brightening
steadily. Between 1929 and 1959, while the nation as a
whole was increasing its per capita personal incomes by 208
per cent, South Carolina was jumping 393 per cent and
Louisiana 280 per cent.</p>

<p>Permit a few more statistics. The South’s traditional distaste
for government remains quite evident. Florida, Louisiana,
and Oklahoma have slightly more than the average number
of State and local government workers in terms of population,
but the others are far below the national average. The South
has small appetite for the welfare state; our relief rolls are
large, owing chiefly to social difficulties among the Negroes,
but grants are kept relentlessly low. Our people are churchgoers,
in fantastic numbers. We continue to produce more
moonshine whiskey than any other region. In 1961, there
were 486 daily newspapers in the South, with a circulation
of 12,500,000. Almost 40 per cent of the country’s radio
stations are in the South; North Carolina has more AM
stations than the State of New York, and Texas has more
radio stations than anybody.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The foregoing figures tell little enough, to be sure, about
the South; you learn nothing much about a sonnet by a footnote
on its rhyme scheme. For it is a truism that there is not
one South; there are, it is said, many Souths.</p>

<p>Eighteen hundred miles separate the Rio Grande at El
Paso from the James at Hampton Roads. The intervening
land is immensely varied. The South begins, at its western
rim, in canyon country, red-walled, black-hilled; the bare and
bony mountains stretch across the prairie like the skeletons
of dinosaurs. This is hard country, burned by the sun and
wrinkled by the unceasing wind; this is Texas, and almost
everything men say of it is true. Oklahoma, to the north, is
a pocket paper-back edition of its brawny southern neighbor.
Both States offer moments of surpassing beauty and long
stretches of surpassing dullness; they offer a splendid, lonesome
emptiness of time and space, and then, abruptly, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
sophistication of Dallas and the busy commerce of Oklahoma
City and Houston.</p>

<p>Coming east, one finds Arkansas, and below it Louisiana;
Ozark country, the endless foothills that never quite reach
to the foot of anything, to the south the flatlands and bayous,
the white cranes flying, the River, incredibly massive, the
jeweled city one caresses as a mistress in his dreams.</p>

<p>Across the River, Mississippi and Alabama: cotton country,
bottom land, mules and iron; small towns that evoke in bank
and clock and feed store, in the inevitable bronze soldier
standing guard in courthouse square, the image of small
towns everywhere; progress and poverty, the hot breath of
Birmingham, the Monopoly suburbs, their roofs all in line
and neat bibs of crab grass under their chins.</p>

<p>On to the east, Georgia: red clay and cotton, the prosperous
incongruity of Atlanta, resting on the homely landscape
like a diamond stickpin on a shabby tie. To the south, the
separate nation that is Florida, post-card blue, lemon yellow,
an old man nodding on a St. Petersburg bench, a swamp
child gazing from a quiet pier; Miami, and the Beach, the
liquid ripple of Cuban tongues; the bonefish, silver as sixteenth
notes in amethyst water. Back again to the north:
Tennessee, timbered, taciturn, green-hilled, the great lakes of
the TVA; Memphis and Knoxville and Nashville; the accent
that thins a short <em>e</em> to a short <em>i</em>. Above Tennessee, Kentucky,
tied inescapably now to the North and Midwest, hard politics,
soft speech, burley tobacco, and good bourbon.</p>

<p>To the east again, Virginia and South Carolina, with North
Carolina between them, “a valley of humility between two
mountains of conceit,” or more accurately, a peak of giddy-up
between two valleys of whoa. South Carolina is moss and
small creeks, camellias, azaleas, the rugs a little thin, the
white tapers gleaming, ancestors on the walls and Calhoun’s
brooding spirit still alive, Camden and Columbia, and a
classic capitol still pocked by Yankee shells. To the north,
tobacco country; Charlotte, thrusting ahead, brief-cased,
snap-brimmed; universities, schools, textiles, furniture mills,
the black cypress quietude of the inland waterway.</p>

<p>Finally, Virginia, stretching four hundred miles from her
coal country to her beaches; tobacco and peanuts; the gem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
that is Williamsburg, the plantation country, the somnolent
Northern Neck, Mr. Jefferson’s University, the hunt country,
the changelessly changing capital city where I write.</p>

<p>This land of ours is many-rivered, and the rivers have
lovely names: the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Pee Dee,
Yadkin, Tombigbee, Brazoo, Mobile, the York, the James,
the Mattaponi. Our mountains are mostly old, worn down,
the edges rubbed off: the Blue Ridge, the Alleghenies, the
Great Smokies, the Ozarks. Our summers are hot and humid;
the winters are uninteresting outside of Florida; but spring
in the South is a cool <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rosé</i>, and October in Virginia is a
sparkling champagne. I speak to the court in this brief, as
Your Honors will have noted, with an affection that ought
perhaps to be brought back in bounds; along with the most
beautiful horses in the world, we have some of the meanest
mosquitoes south of New Jersey, an oversupply of shif’less
dogs, and vast quantities of stinging nettles; we have sandflies,
horned toads, and chiggers; we have our fair share of men
who give short weight, of bigoted men, unkind, intolerant;
we are given in a Cavalier South to drinking too much, and
in the Bible Belt, to drinking not enough; we have men who
honk at traffic lights, and women who giggle, and politicians
who are full of wind; the Southern Shintoism that is sometimes
a blessing is as often a curse; some of our cities are
dirty, and most of our streets have lumps in them. But this
is the many-faceted, cloudy, crystalline compound called
the South.</p>

<p>Yet, no, <em>it is not the South</em>. The truism of “many Souths”
will not stand too much weight. Every region in the country
has its contrasts, its extremes, its anomalies, its measurable
differences. An essential point can be missed in overconcentration
on the Rural South, the Urban South, the New South,
the Old South, the Liberal South, the Conservative South.
There remains a great and well-understood meaning simply
in <em>the</em> South; there is, in fact, a sense of oneness here, an
identity, a sharing, and this quality makes the South unique
in ways that New England, and the Midwest, and the West
do not approach. The Confederacy was, as a matter of law,
a state in being; but it was first of all, and still is, what so
many observers have termed it: a state of mind. And running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
through this state of mind, now loose as basting thread, now
knotted as twine, now strong and stubborn as wire, coloring
the whole fabric of our lives, is this inescapable awareness:
the consciousness of the Negro.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>How, in 1962, does one begin to discuss this awareness?
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa?</i> No, perhaps,
the best observation to make at the outset is that the South,
in general, feels no sharp sense of sin at its “treatment of
the Negro.” The guilt hypothesis is vastly overdrawn. If
wrong has been done (and doubtless wrong has been done),
we reflect that within the human relationship wrong always
has been done, by one people upon another, since tribal
cavemen quarreled with club and stone. And whatever the
wrongs may have been, the white South emphatically refuses
to accept all the wrongs as her own. For the South
itself has been wronged&mdash;cruelly and maliciously wronged,
by men in high places whose hypocrisy is exceeded only by
their ignorance, men whose trade is to damn the bigotry of
the segregated South by day and to sleep in lily-white
Westchester County by night. We are keenly aware, as
Perry Morgan remarked in a telling phrase, of a North
that wishes to denounce discrimination and have it too.</p>

<p>But let us begin gently. The Southerner who would
grope seriously for understanding of his own perplexing
region, and the non-Southerner who would seek in earnest
to learn more than his textbooks would tell him, cannot
make a start with <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em> on a May
afternoon in 1954. Neither can he begin with <em>Plessy</em> v.
<em>Ferguson</em> in 1896, or with ratification of the Fourteenth
Amendment in 1868, or with Appomattox three years earlier.
A start has to be made much earlier, in 1619, when the first
twenty Negroes arrived from Africa aboard a Dutch slaver
and fastened upon the South a wretched incubus that the
belated penances of New Englanders have not expiated at
all.</p>

<p>We of the South have been reared from that day in a
strange society that only now&mdash;and how uncomfortably!&mdash;is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
becoming known at first hand outside the South. This
is the dual society, made up of white and Negro coexisting
in an oddly intimate remoteness. It is a way of life that has
to be experienced. Children mask their eyes and play at
being blind. Even so, some of my Northern friends mask
their eyes and play at being Southern; they try to imagine
what it must be like to be white in the South, to be Negro
in the South. Novelist John Griffin dyed his skin and spent
three weeks or so pretending to be Negro, looking for
incidents to confirm his prejudices. But a child always knows
that he can take his hands from his eyes, and see, that he
is not really blind; and those who have not grown up from
childhood, and fashioned their whole world from a delicately
bounded half a world, cannot comprehend what this is all
about. They wash the dye from their imaginations, and put
aside <cite>The New York Times</cite>, and awake to a well-ordered
society in which the Negroes of their personal acquaintance
are sipping martinis and talking of Middle Eastern diplomacy.
They form an image of “the Negro” (as men form an image
of the French, or the British, or the Japanese) in terms of
the slim and elegant Harvard student, the eloquent spokesman
of a civil rights group, the trim stenographer in a
publishing office: Thurgood Marshall on the bench, Ralph
Bunche in the lecture hall. It is a splendid image, finely
engraved on brittle glass, an object of universal admiration
on the mantle of the <cite>New Republic</cite>. It is an image scarcely
known in the South.</p>

<p>My father came from New Orleans. His father, a captain
in the Confederate Army, returned from the War and
established a prosperous business in ship chandlery there.
And though I myself was born in Oklahoma, Father having
moved there just prior to World War I, we children visited
along the Delta in our nonage. We sailed on Pontchartrain,
and crabbed at Pass Christian, and once or twice were taken
from school in February to sit spellbound on Canal Street
and watch the Mardi Gras go by. Our life in Oklahoma was
New Orleans once removed; it was a life our playmates
accepted as matter-of-factly as children of a coast accept
the tides: The Negroes <em>were</em>; we <em>were</em>. They had their lives;
we had ours. There were certain things one did: A proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
white child obeyed the family Negroes, ate with them,
bothered them, teased them, loved them, lived with them,
learned from them. And there were certain things one did
not do: One did not intrude upon their lives, or ask about
Negro institutions, or bring a Negro child in the front door.
And at five, or six, or seven, one accepted, without question,
that Calline and Cubboo, who were vaguely the charges of
a Negro gardener up the street, had their schools; and we
had ours.</p>

<p>Does all this have the air of a chapter from William
Gilmore Simms or a post-bellum romance by Thomas Nelson
Page? I myself lived it, forty years ago; my own sons have
lived it in this generation. My father lived it, and his father
before him. For three hundred years, the South has lived
with this subconsciousness of race. Who hears a clock tick,
or the surf murmur, or the trains pass? Not those who live
by the clock or the sea or the track. In the South, the acceptance
of racial separation begins in the cradle. What
rational man imagines this concept can be shattered overnight?</p>

<p>We had two Negroes who served my family more than
twenty years. One was Lizzie. The other was Nash. Lizzie
was short and plump and placid, and chocolate-brown; she
“lived on,” in a room and bath over the garage, and her
broad face never altered in its kindness. Nash was short
and slim, older, better educated, more a leader; she was
African-black; and as a laundress, she came in after church
on Sundays, put the clothes down to soak in the basement
tubs, gossiped with Lizzie, scolded her, raised Lizzie’s sights.
On Monday, the two of them did the wash, hanging the
clothes on heavy wire lines outside the kitchen door, and
late in the afternoon Nash ironed. She pushed the iron with
an economical push-push, thump; turn the shirt; push-push,
thump. And I would come home from school to the smell
of starch and the faint scorch of the iron and the push-push,
thump, and would descend to the basement only to be
ordered upstairs to wash my hands and change out of school
clothes.</p>

<p>Toward the end of their lives, disaster came to both of
them. Lizzie went slowly blind, through some affliction no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
surgeon could correct, and Nash lost the middle three fingers
of one hand when her scarf tangled in the bellows of a
church organ. Nevertheless, they stayed with us until age
at last put them on the sidelines. And as far as love and
devotion and respect can reach, they were members of the
family. Yet I often have wondered, in later years, did we
children know them? Did Mother and Father know them?
I do not think we did.</p>

<p>This relationship, loving but unknowing, has characterized
the lives of thousands of Southern children on farms and in
the cities too. White infants learn to feel invisible fences as
they crawl, to sense unwritten boundaries as they walk. And
I know this much, that Negro children are brought up to
sense these boundaries too. What is so often misunderstood,
outside the South, is this delicate intimacy of human beings
whose lives are so intricately bound together. I have met
Northerners who believe, in all apparent seriousness, that
segregation in the South means literally that: <em>segregation</em>,
the races stiffly apart, never touching. A wayfaring stranger
from the New York <cite>Herald Tribune</cite> implied as much in a
piece he wrote from Virginia after the school decision. His
notion was that whites and Negroes did not even say “good
morning” to each other. God in heaven!</p>

<p>In plain fact, the relationship between white and Negro
in the segregated South, in the country and in the city, has
been far closer, more honest, less constrained, than such
relations generally have been in the integrated North. In
Charleston and New Orleans, among many other cities,
residential segregation does not exist, for example, as it
exists in Detroit or Chicago. In the country, whites and
Negroes are farm neighbors. They share the same calamities&mdash;the
mud, the hail, the weevils&mdash;and they minister, in their
own unfelt, unspoken way, to one another. Is the relationship
that of master and servant, superior and inferior? Down
deep, doubtless it is, but I often wonder if this is more of
a wrong to the Negro than the affected, hearty “equality” encountered
in the North. In the years I lived on a farm, I
fished often with a Negro tenant, hour after hour, he paddling,
I paddling, sharing the catch, and we tied up the boat
and casually went our separate ways. Before <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
of Education</em>, it never occurred to me that in these peaceful
hours I was inflicting upon him wounds of the psyche not
likely ever to be undone. I do not believe it occurred to
Robert either. This is not the way one goes fly-casting on a
millpond, with Gunnar Myrdal invisibly present on the middle
thwart. We fish no more. He has been busy in recent years,
and I too; and when I came across the flyrod recently, I
found the line rotted and the ferrules broken.</p>

<p>I say this relationship “has been,” and in the past perfect
lies a melancholy change that disturbs many Southerners
deeply. In my observation, a tendency grows in much of the
white South to acknowledge and to abandon, with no more
than a ritual protest, many of the patent absurdities of “Jim
Crow.” Many of these practices, so deeply resented in recent
years by the Negro, may have had some rational basis when
they were instituted in the post-Reconstruction period. When
the first trolleys came along, the few Negroes who rode them
were mostly servants; others carried with them the fragrance
of farm or livery stable. A Jim Crow section perhaps made
sense in those days. But in my own nonage, during the
1920s, and in the years since then, few Southerners ever
paused to examine the reasons for segregation on streetcars.
We simply moved the little portable sign that separated
white from Negro as a car filled up, and whites sat in front
of the sign and Negroes sat behind it. This was the way we
rode streetcars. After <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, when
the abiding subconsciousness of the Negro turned overnight
into an acute and immediate awareness of the Negro, some
of these laws and customs ceased to be subject to reason
anyhow; they became, confusingly, matters of strategy; they
became occupied ground in an undeclared war, not to be
yielded lest their yielding be regarded as needless surrender.
Many aspects of our lives have gone that way since. The
unwritten rules of generations are now being, in truth, unwritten;
in their place, it is proposed by the apostles of
instant integration that there be no rules at all. It seems so
easy: “What difference does the color of a man’s skin make?”
“Why not just treat them as equals?” “There is no such
thing as race.”</p>

<p>Ah, but it is not so easy. The ingrained attitudes of a lifetime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
cannot be jerked out like a pair of infected molars,
and new porcelain dentures put in their place. For this is
what our Northern friends will not comprehend: The South,
agreeable as it may be to confessing some of its sins and to
bewailing its more manifest wickednesses, simply does not
concede that at bottom its basic attitude is “infected” or
wrong. On the contrary, the Southerner rebelliously clings
to what seems to him the hard core of truth in this whole
controversy: <em>Here and now</em>, in his own communities, in the
mid-1960s, the Negro race, as a race, plainly is not equal to
the white race, as a race; nor, for that matter, in the wider
world beyond, by the accepted judgment of ten thousand
years, has the Negro race, as a race, <em>ever</em> been the cultural
or intellectual equal of the white race, as a race.</p>

<p>This we take to be a plain statement of fact, and if we
are not amazed that our Northern antagonists do not accept
it as such, we are resentful that they will not even look at
the proposition, or hear of it, or inquire into it. Those of
us who have ventured to discuss the issues outside the South
have discovered, whenever the point arises, that no one is
so intolerant of truth as academicians whose profession it is
to pursue it. The whole question of race has become a
closed question: the earth is a cube, and there’s an end to it;
Two and two are four, the sun rises in the east, and no race
is inferior to any other race. Even the possibility of a conflicting
hypothesis is beyond the realm of sober examination.
John Hope Franklin, chairman of the history department at
Brooklyn College, sees Southern attitudes on race as a “hoax.”
Their wrongness is “indisputable.” To Ashley Montagu, race
is a myth. A UNESCO pamphlet makes the flat, unqualified
statement that “modern biological and psychological studies
of the differences between races do not support the idea that
one is superior to another as far as innate potentialities are
concerned.” And when one inquires, why, pray, has it taken
so long for the Negro’s innately equal potentialities to emerge,
the answers trail off into lamentations on the conditions under
which the Negro has lived. Thus, the doctrine of environment,
like the principle of charity, is trotted out to conceal
a multitude of sins. The fault, if there be any fault, is held
to be not in men’s genes, but in their substandard housing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>All this is to anticipate some of the points this brief is
intended to develop, but it is perhaps as well to know where
the argument is going. The South does not wish to be cruel,
or unkind, or intolerant, or bigoted; but in this area it does
not wish to be unrealistic either. We do not agree that our
“prejudice” in this regard is prejudice at all, in the pejorative
sense in which the word is widely used. The man who wakes
up ten times with a hangover, having had too much brandy
the night before, is not “prejudiced” against brandy if on
the eleventh occasion he passes the brandy by; he has merely
learned to respect its qualities. And what others see as the
dark night of our bigotry is regarded, in our own observation,
as the revealing light of experience. It guides our feet. As
Patrick Henry said, we know no other light to go by.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The consciousness of the Negro, I have said, is one common
thread in the fabric of the South. There are others,
identified by countless observers who have looked upon this
tapestry, that merit some discussion also. Let me expand for
a few moments on three themes: The Southerner as Conservative,
the Southerner as Romantic, the Southerner as
Realist.</p>

<p>Russell Kirk, in <cite>The Conservative Mind</cite>, examined the
philosophy that generally is identified as “Southern conservatism”
and found it rooted in four impulses. Apart from the
Southerner’s sensitivity to the Negro question, he said, there
is (1) his half-indolent distaste for alteration, (2) his determination
to preserve an agricultural society, and (3) his love
for local rights. These are good starting points. It was John
Randolph who laid it down, as a first principle of political
activity, never needlessly to disturb a thing at rest. The pace
of life <em>is</em> slower in the South, and the tendency cannot be
accounted for simply in terms of a climate that often makes
it “too hot to move.” We are by nature a contemplative
people, and I am inclined to believe this stems from the
agrarian tradition. A farm boy learns early that some things
can’t be hurried&mdash;the birth of calves, the tasseling of corn,
the curing of tobacco. On the farm, life is governed by patience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
by the inexorable equinoctial rotation of the seasons,
by factors beyond man’s control. It is, we say, “God’s will.”</p>

<p>And until quite recently, as the census records show, the
agricultural society was our prevailing society. Moreover,
the 1960 census figures on urbanization, within the context
of the South, can be highly misleading. A great part of this
statistically “urban” population lives in towns so small that
the towns are spiritually and economically a part of the
rural countryside around them. There were in 1960 only
seventy metropolitan areas of more than 50,000 population
in the thirteen States, and twenty of these were in Texas. In
Mississippi, Jackson has edged past 100,000, but no other
city in the State is even close to that mark. Outside of Fort
Smith and Little Rock, Arkansas is a State of small towns.
This is even truer of North Carolina; fewer than one-fourth
of the State’s four and a half million residents live in the six
principal cities (the largest is Charlotte, with a metropolitan
population of 272,000). The others are scattered through
scores of towns and villages. Georgia is statistically “urban”
now, but urban attitudes are largely concentrated in Atlanta,
and perhaps four other cities. Beyond Charleston, Columbia,
and perhaps Greenville, South Carolina is almost as countrified
today as it was in the time of Calhoun.</p>

<p>The slowness of life in the country, where diversions are
few and the reasons for haste almost nil, tends to breed men
who are highly resistant to change. They know, as well as
they know anything, that change and progress are not necessarily
to be equated; and for all the tub-thumping that goes
on in local chambers of commerce, many a Southerner is not
so sure he is in favor of progress anyhow. The Northern
Neck of Virginia, for one example, has a positive antipathy
to altering anything.</p>

<p>The conservatism that is identified with the South, as W.
J. Cash remarked in his great work, <cite>The Mind of the South</cite>,
runs continuously with the past. It embraces also a strong
sense of community, of <em>place</em>, of local institutions and families
and classes. Primogeniture vanished with the American
Revolution, but its vestigial spirit may be observed at every
hand; whole generations of Randolphs have been lawyers,
and whole generations of Tuckers have been doctors and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
ministers. The South is a land not only of “Juniors,” but of
“IIIs” and even “IVs.”</p>

<p>Because of this intense spirit of local as well as State
identification, an almost universal dedication to “strong local
government” is apparent. There is more to this than local
sentiment. If there is one aspect of Southern conservatism
more pronounced than the others, it is the instinctive suspicion
of all government that forever stirs uneasily in the
Southern mind. Cash has described as “the ruling element”
of Southern tradition, this “intense distrust of, and, indeed,
downright aversion to, any actual exercise of authority beyond
the barest minimum essential to the existence of the social
organism.” We do not <em>like</em> authority, especially needless, lint-picking,
petty authority, and a broody pessimism constantly
evokes the apprehension that government, if given half a
chance, will put a fast one over on the people. In the eternal
conflict of man and the state, the South stands in spirit, at
least, firmly on man’s side. From the very beginning of the
American Republic, our ruling doctrines have been based
upon strict limitation of the powers of government. The
people of Virginia came warily into the Union, in 1788, on
the explicit understanding that the political powers they were
lending the central government “may be resumed by them
whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or
oppression,” and the Virginians wanted it known that “every
power not granted [to the central government] under the
Constitution remains with them and at their will.” Ten years
later, when this promise of pessimism was abundantly fulfilled
in the Sedition Act, Kentucky and Virginia were beside
themselves. What could be done to restrain officials who
usurped power? “Bind them down,” thundered Jefferson,
“with the chains of the Constitution!”</p>

<p>Still another aspect of Southern conservatism, deeply
rooted in the agrarian tradition, is the respect for property
that dwells inherently in the Southern mind to this day.
George Mason, composing the Virginia Declaration of Rights,
did not hesitate to use the word itself; man’s inalienable
rights, he declared, embraced not only the enjoyment of life
and liberty, but also the means of acquiring and possessing
<em>property</em>. Part of this feeling may stem from the Englishman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
tradition of his home as his castle, and part from the farmer’s
conviction that, though the bottom fall out of the market on
corn or pigs or cotton or tobacco, in the end his land will
sustain him.</p>

<p>Whatever the root sources, the tendency has carried over
even to the expanding cities of the urbanized South. It has
not been a fear of integrated housing (this specter is a late
arrival on the scene) that has made the South relatively so
slow to embrace Federal grants for slum clearance, public
housing, and urban renewal. Much of the public resistance,
sometimes made manifest and sometimes merely sensed, is
a consequence of this inbred feeling for property; it is a feeling
that responsibility for housing rests with the individual
first of all, and that no man’s property should be taken under
eminent domain except for literal public use. When Southern
cities experienced their first wave of dime-store “sit-ins,”
early in 1960, the startled reaction sped at once to the rights
of the store owner: This lunch counter was his <em>property</em>. Did
he not have a right to control its use?</p>

<p>Finally, I would suggest that the Southerner as Conservative
is affected, perhaps more strongly than he himself would
acknowledge, by a respect for divine power. Again, the agrarian
inheritance plays a part in this legacy. The miracle of the
seed, the continuum of the forest, the closeness of animal
birth and life&mdash;these work a profound influence on men
whose existence is tied umbilically to nature. In the loneliness
of field or prairie, the smallness of man and the largeness of
God strike to the heart’s core. The blessing of the harvest,
the wrath of the storm, and the benediction of a slow and
mizzling rain on freshly seeded land speak to the Southerner
of God’s handiwork.</p>

<p>Perhaps by reason of these influences, organized religion,
predominantly among low-church Protestant denominations,
continues to play a pervasive role in Southern life. To be sure,
the parent Protestantism gives off some notable sports&mdash;the
Faith Healers, snake-handlers, and the Holy Rollers&mdash;and the
abiding fundamentalism of the region continues to manifest
itself in pockets of strict Prohibition and in contemporary
versions of the Tennessee Monkey Trial. But religion crops
up in other ways, in the grace before meals expected at every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
public function, in the phenomenal sales of religious books,
and in the incredible proliferation of choirs, sodalities, ladies’
auxiliaries, young peoples’ groups, vestries, boards of deacons,
church suppers, and building-committee meetings that characterize
life from Brownsville to Virginia’s Eastern Shore. A
Southerner who does not belong to <em>some</em> church is not regarded
as suspect, exactly, but he is just a little odd. And if
the low-tax Southerner traditionally is penurious in rendering
unto his Caesars the things that are Caesar’s, he is often
sacrificial in rendering unto God the things that are God’s.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The deference that is paid to Holy Writ and to evidences
of divine intervention doubtless contributes to the character
of the Southerner as Romantic. Faith and superstition and
myth are cousins, hardly even once removed, and whatever
else it may be, the South is first of all a land of legends. This
is a terrible annoyance to historians; they look upon our
pretty myths, and know they are not so, and expose their
fallacies in a thousand footnotes, but like the South, the
legends rise again. “Few groups in the New World have had
their myths subjected to such destructive analysis as those of
the South have undergone in recent years,” C. Vann Woodward
once observed.</p>

<p>Yet the myths persist. There is the Old South legend of the
white-columned plantation, the hoop-skirted belles, the hot-blooded
men. In the foreground, beneath the magnolia trees,
the darkies are plucking banjos; in the background, rows upon
rows of cotton, and off to one side, a steamboat coming
around the bend. Master loves the Negroes, and the Negroes
love old Master. The words and music are by Stephen Foster.
This, we like to say, was how things <em>were</em> in the ante-bellum
South. The exasperated scholar, emerging from his Will
Books, cries out his anguish in the quarterly reviews: The
records <em>prove</em> it was not so; they prove that slave ownership
was limited; the records prove that Southern Negroes&mdash;as
many as 100,000 or 200,000 of them&mdash;deserted to the Union
cause in the War; the records probably prove there weren’t
but thirty-two banjos in all of Carolina.</p>

<p>These labors of genealogy go utterly unrewarded. With
what Cash has described as the South’s “naive capacity for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
unreality,” our people pat the historians on their fevered
brows, thank them kindly just the same, and return untroubled
to an intuitive devotion to the things that never
were.</p>

<p>“I am an aristocrat,” cried Randolph of Roanoke. And the
Southerner regards him with an affection not extended to
Clay or Calhoun or Jefferson. So, we imagine, were they all&mdash;<em>all</em>
aristocrats, men of ease, and grace, and elegance, and high
birth; men who lived by a code of honor, and died beneath
the dueling oaks; men who gambled with skill, and loved
with passion; men who fought with a royal disdain for risk.
Well, Cash and Woodward and a dozen others have had a
hand in exploding this Cavalier myth. Tediously, with infinite
pains, they have dredged up the pedestrian facts. The Southerner
will have none of them; he knows better than to let a
few facts interfere with a good story. His colonists all wear
ruffled collars; his ladies, blue-veined, are pale and pure as
talisman roses. “<em>I am an aristocrat: I love freedom; I hate
equality!</em>” Who in the South could disclaim the Randolph
inheritance?</p>

<p>It is not only the myths of the pre-Revolutionary South
and the ante-bellum South that have been so sharply assailed.
The Southwest’s legends of the cowboy have been worked
over too. The frontiersmen of Tennessee and Kentucky, on
examination, prove to be something less than godlike men.
The Creole stories of New Orleans, the richly embroidered
legends of the War of ’61-’65, the tales of Reconstruction
hardships, even the twentieth-century chronicle of Jim Crow,
have been cracked by the academic refineries&mdash;but no catalyst
ever seems wholly effective. As soft as Spanish moss, and
almost as insubstantial, legends subtly dominate the Southern
mind.</p>

<p>And it is not a bad thing. Legend is born of truth, however
remote and obscure the fatherhood may be, and legend has
a way of siring truths stamped in ancestral molds. The hospitality
of the plantation, as a universal pastime, may not
bear too strong a light; but “Southern hospitality,” its descendant,
is a working truth today. Not all the colonists were
Cavaliers, and not all the Cavaliers, we may reasonably
assume, were mannered men; but a Southern manner, born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
of the Cavalier myth, persists in our own time. It is the
Virginian’s “Sir,” the Texan’s “Ma’am.” To the Southerner, in
Burke’s phrase, manners are always more important than law.
Deference to women, principles of personal honor, the payment
of a gentleman’s debts&mdash;these are operative aspects of
the “Southern Way of Life.” Objections of “unreality” are put
to one side.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, may it please the court, there is the Southerner as
Realist too. It is the weight that balances. Cash wrote of the
tendency in New England, in the Reconstruction period, for
men to turn increasingly to science and technology, and increasingly
away from the customary forms of religion. “But
in the South,” he said, “the movement was to the opposite
quarter. For invariably when men anywhere have come upon
times of great stress, when they have labored under the
sense of suffering unbearable and unjust ill and there was
doubt of deliverance through their own unaided effort, they
have clung more closely to God and ardently reaffirmed their
belief. Invariably they have tended to repudiate innovation, to
cast off accretion, to return upon the more primitive faith of
the past as representing a purer dispensation and a safer
fortress. And if I have represented our Southerners as determined
to have the mastery, yet it must be said that terror
was continually threatening to seize the ascendancy, that
there was in their thought a huge vein of gloomy foreboding,
which trembled constantly on the verge of despair.”</p>

<p>The student of our affairs who does not understand this
much about the South does not understand the South at all.
I do not know who it was who made the observation first&mdash;Donald
Davidson, or Richard Weaver, or Louis Rubin, or
Arthur Schlesinger, or Vann Woodward, or some forgotten
historian of eighty years ago; it does not really matter; untutored,
I wrote it myself in high school&mdash;that alone among
all the regions of the Union, the South has known defeat. To
know defeat is to know sin; it is the ultimate blasphemy
against the American theology. As a nation, we are geared to
instant success: Listerine will vanish bad breath, and Bufferin
will cure a headache; a touch of Wildroot will clear up one’s
dandruff; any boy may aspire to be President, or to make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
million dollars, or to play center field for the Yankees. Failure&mdash;permanent,
total, unqualified failure&mdash;is unknown. It is
intolerable. It shatters the grand American illusion.</p>

<p>But the South has known failure. It has known what it is
to do one’s best, to fight to exhaustion, and to lose. This
huge vein of gloomy foreboding, this constant trembling on
the verge of despair, was not an isolated phenomenon of the
Reconstruction period. In Cash’s phrase, it is part of the
collective experience of the Southern people. We have known
defeat.</p>

<p>And not in war only. Long before the War, as the industrial
North leaped to surpass the agrarian South, the thin, serrated
edge of poverty began to cut across the South. The
Tariff of Abominations was a beginning of it, and Calhoun
and the South cried out in anger against its unfairness. The
terrible institution of slavery contributed to it, but slavery was
a tiger by the tail, and men could not cling to it successfully
or safely let it go. There was the War, and the westward expansion,
and the lines of commerce that flowed east and west
but seldom north and south. The bitter years of Reconstruction
resulted in a lean and grinding poverty, a poorness the
more pitiful for its stoic acceptance by a proud people. And
we know that poorness yet: Look at the <cite>Statistical Abstract</cite>.</p>

<p>Defeat. Poverty. And Woodward adds to these two grim
horsemen still a third: a sense of guilt. While the rest of the
Republic has basked complacently in its own virtue, the
South’s preoccupation has been with guilt, not with innocence,
“with the reality of evil, not with the dream of perfection.”
To Woodward’s shrewd insight, I would add a few
reflections of my own. This preoccupation with guilt and this
reality of evil have not been burdens the South has felt it
could regard honestly as entirely its own responsibility. The
“peculiar institutions” of slavery and segregation have descended
upon the South like pregnancy upon a woman whose
lover has ridden away. The New England slavemasters had
their fun, and made their dreadful profits, and sailed off to
Maine; and they left the South to raise the alien child. Oh,
it was a willing union. It was not rape, not seduction. The
Southerners who bought the frightened blacks lived for a
hundred years in agreeable sin with the European and New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
England slavers who sold them. But when the assignation
ended, the South had all the problems, and the North had all
the answers. Thus the preoccupation with guilt is mixed with
a resentment for hypocrisy; and when the North speaks loftily
to the South, and asserts that we of the North are holier
than thou, three hundred years of skepticism seek an outlet:
Pray, sirs, since when?</p>

<p>This should be said, too, about Woodward’s “reality of
evil.” Surely there have been evils in the South’s policies of
racial separation. Poor as the South was, in the sixty years
after Reconstruction that preceded World War II, much
more could have been done, and should have been done, to
encourage the Negro people closer to a cultural and economic
equality. I have said it countless times, and say it
willingly here: If the South had devoted one tenth of the
effort toward keeping schools equal that it devoted to keeping
them separate, <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em> would not
have created so dramatic a crisis. Yes, there have been evils,
and very real and poignant and tragic evils, in the South’s
treatment of its Negro people.</p>

<p>But I would raise the question if the “evils” have been all
on the side of the white South. <em>All</em> of them? The reality that
the South has had to cope with most constantly, beyond the
realities of defeat and poverty, is the reality of the Southern
Negro. Other races of men, caught at the bottom of the
ladder, have clambered up. The identical decades that saw
Negroes set free in the South saw the Irish set down in New
England. “No Irish need apply.” The signs hung outside New
England mills as uncompromisingly as the “white only” signs
outside an Alabama men’s room. Who would have imagined
in, say, 1880, that a Boston Irish Catholic would be President?
But the Irish fought their own way up, on merit and
ambition and hard work. They <em>made</em> a place at the table.
They won acceptance, and they paid their own way.</p>

<p>No such reality has been visible in the South. Instead of
ambition (I speak in general terms), we have witnessed indolence;
instead of skill, ineptitude; instead of talent, an inability
to learn. It is all very well for social theorists to say
of Southern Negroes that they are <em>capable</em> of this, and their
<em>potential</em> is for that, and if it were not for segregation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
second-class citizenship and denial of opportunity, they would
have achieved thus and so; but the Southerner, to paraphrase
Burke, is not so much interested in determining a point of
metaphysics&mdash;he is interested in maintaining tranquility. The
Southerner may dwell more than others upon the past and
brood more intently on the distant future, but in his daily
life he has to be concerned with the here and now&mdash;in brief,
he has to be concerned with reality.</p>

<p>The first reality he faces squarely is the one reality most
often shunned: the <em>inequality</em> of man. The typical Southerner,
out of the observation and experience of his lifetime,
would accept Burke’s thesis that universal equality may exist,
but only as the equality of Christianity&mdash;moral equality, or,
more precisely, equality in the ultimate judgment of God. He
knows that “no other equality exists, or may be imagined to
exist.” The South holds small enthusiasm for egalitarian doctrines
based upon the infinite perfectibility of man. With
John Adams, who would have made a splendid Southerner,
we know that men are foolish; that men are not benevolent;
and we regard this as a normal condition of existence. Theoretically,
to be sure, men are born to equal rights; but empirically,
for good or ill, these rights are incapable of equal
exercise. All men are not born with equal powers and faculties,
said Adams, “to equal influence in society, to equal property
and advantages through life.” These are realities, and the
Southerner as Realist accepts them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is necessary, even in the most affectionate examination
of the South and its case before the bar, to insert a number
of qualifications and to take account of some dismaying contradictions.
The South, I have said, is a distinct political,
cultural, and social entity, knit together by hundreds of years
of shared experiences. But it was a lively and a valid question,
in the postwar decade that preceded the <em>Brown</em> decision,
whether this entity would survive. On every hand the “New
South” was heralded; the rural tradition was dying, and bulldozers
were ripping up the groves of the Nashville agrarians.
The provincialisms that had distinguished the South, sometimes
mocked, sometimes admired, seemed to be on the way
out: Southern cooking, the Southern accent, the South’s pride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
in being Southern. Dixie, it was said, was rejoining the Union;
soon it would rejoin the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The future of “Southern nationalism” still seems to me a
valid question. Does it have a future? In the years that followed
immediately upon the <em>Brown</em> decision, make no mistake,
the essential unity of the South was abruptly revived.
Mr. Chief Justice Warren’s gavel echoed the guns of Sumter,
and the “Southern Manifesto” in Congress rang with the
sound of bugles. Every latent instinct in the mind of the traditional
South rose to the fore: States’ rights, strict construction,
resentment of central authority, deference to the past.
The Southerner as Conservative found his principles outraged;
the Southerner as Romantic saw his dream castles besieged
by barbarians; and the Southerner as Realist, with a
sense of dreadful foreboding, turned to the coming storm.</p>

<p>The <em>Brown</em> decision operated with galvanic force upon the
South; but as this is written, eight years after <em>Brown</em>, it is
apparent that the electric shock has lost at least some of its
impact. The South, in many respects, is still one; but the
prodigious energies that were set in motion after World War
II are beginning to reassert themselves widely. If one reads
the recent Messages and Inaugural Addresses of Southern
Governors, he will find segregation barely mentioned. Everywhere,
the emphasis is on industrial promotion, tourist promotion,
expansion of higher education. The problems that
increasingly absorb Southern legislatures are problems common
to such bodies across the Republic&mdash;taxation, highways,
mental health, the control of air and water pollution.</p>

<p>In brief, I doubt that “the Negro question,” by which is
meant the fear of integration and of a revolutionary Negro
ascendancy, will provide a sufficient force, in itself, to keep
the South welded together. The fears of 1954 are subsiding,
as it becomes apparent that there will be no significant integration
(not in the definitive sense in which I use the word,
as a condition quite distinct from “desegregation”); and we
observe that the revolution so many Northerners jubilantly
anticipated in <em>Brown</em> is not to be a two-day <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, but
a thirty-year Peloponnesian War. Beyond the borders of
Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, interest wanes. In Virginia,
the assignment of a Negro child to a formerly white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
school now rates a two-inch item on <cite>The News Leader’s</cite>
page 48.</p>

<p>What of the other common themes that tie the South together
and make the region distinct? What of Southern conservatism?
What of the Southern manner? These traits will
endure, I believe, though a wry acknowledgment may be
made of persuasive evidence to the contrary. It is perfectly
true that the Conservative’s traditional animosity to centralization
has a way of disappearing in the South when bills are
called up in the Congress to support cotton, and peanuts, and
tobacco. The Conservative opposes socialism and all its
works; it is his favorite devil; but the steam plants of the
TVA seem to be marvelously exempt from his anathema. It
was a Georgian whose name was longest and most lustrously
identified with foreign aid, and an Alabaman whose plan of
Federal subsidies for hospitals bears his name, and an Oklahoman
who has led the Liberal forces in behalf of a Federal
program of medical care. The case for “Southern conservatism”
totters before the voting records of Kefauver, Gore,
Fulbright, Sparkman.</p>

<p>The defense would respond to this indictment by saying
that all things are relative, and in an increasingly Liberal society,
it is only the political center that has moved. The old
Conservative instincts remain, and if they have been much
corrupted, they still manifest themselves in a hundred ways
not necessarily susceptible to roll-call vote. A wise and enlightened
conservatism does not resist all change; it resists
what it views as impulsive change, or change simply for the
sake of change, and this tendency, I believe, remains more
apparent in the South than in other regions. We still resist
abrupt innovation, in art, music, literature, architecture, religion,
public morals. Other regions, in our view, should be
the first to lay the old aside. Instead of casting away all our
old prejudices, as Burke once remarked cheerfully of English
Conservatives, “we cherish them to a very considerable
degree, and, to take more shame to ourselves, we cherish
them because they are prejudices; and the longer they have
lasted, and the more generally they have prevailed the more
we cherish them.” This process of cultural husbandry, this
laying by, has been too long ingrained in the South. I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
imagine its abandonment any time soon.</p>

<p>The South’s identification with “conservatism” will survive,
among other reasons, because it fits so perfectly into the real
or imagined Southern manner. These days, liberalism is identified
with the masses, and not merely identified with them
but equated with them. The race issue to one side, this equation
simply is not a process that comes easily to the Southern
temperament. Implicit in the conservative faith is a high respect
for individual variations, for class, and order, and rank;
and all these are implicit in the Cavalier ideal as well. Aristocracy
is wasted in a shower room; and to the extent that
public institutions are reduced to the level of a public bath,
the Southerner is bound to object. The graces, the little elegancies,
the privileges of birth and office and position&mdash;these
too are long ingrained; they persevere.</p>

<p>To be sure, a good deal of cynical evidence may be
amassed to suggest that this Southern manner, this Southern
romanticism, is as unreal as the myths on which it is based.
When a gang of foul-mouthed Mississippi white men lynch a
fifteen-year-old colored boy, the Southern manner seems a
long way away. And when a rabble of black-jacketed young
punks assemble to jeer at law-abiding Negro students, notions
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i> may seem just that: notions.</p>

<p>But if Southern conservatism may yield now and then to
the temptation of the pork barrel, and Southern romanticism
be attenuated by the impatience of an impatient age, the last
of my four threads may prove stronger than ever: Southern
realism, and with it, the tradition of Southern defeat. For
decades to come, despite the phenomenal population shifts
(and in many instances because of these population shifts),
the South will have to live realistically with the interracial
realities it alone, among all the regions of the country, has
known well. “It is a condition which confronts us,” said
Cleveland of the tariff, “and not a theory.” Just so with race
relations in the South. The gentlest concepts of brotherhood,
the broadest reaches of the law, the finest theories of integration,
go through a sea change in crossing the Potomac. These
comfortable Liberal attitudes emerge from the gauzy mists of
illusion and encounter the blazing sun of fact: <em>These</em> rural
schools, <em>these</em> country people, <em>these</em> children, white and black,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
in <em>these</em> particular towns and villages. The Negro is not moving
in any substantial numbers to the remote rural counties of
the North; he is moving predominantly to the cities, where
everything works in his favor during a period of transition:
job opportunities, the melting-pot tradition, the impersonal
anonymity that protects him in a larval time. Yet millions of
Negroes remain back home in the South, salt-and-peppered
across the rural countryside, and they and their problems
and aspirations are daily, personal realities to the Southerner.
He knows he must cope with them somehow.</p>

<p>And the Southerner knows more than this. He knows, in
the marrow of his bones, that new defeats are entirely probable.
He takes this much profit from the lessons of the past,
that he learns something for the future. Desegregation, as a
legal principle, is accepted inwardly by many of the Southerners
who cry out most vehemently against it. Something of
the spirit has been surrendered. One more defeat has been
experienced, and we know it. In the first few years after
<em>Brown</em>, we perceived in this judicial Gettysburg nothing
finally decisive. The talk then was of sending Governors to
jail, or of challenging the Justice Department to arrest whole
legislatures. Let them call out the troops! Well, Mr. Eisenhower
did call out the troops; and our Governors had second
thoughts about going to jail, and not even the Louisiana legislature
could devise a way to get itself arrested. Little by little,
the hopeless conviction has begun to seep in that it has happened
again, that the courts really <em>mean</em> this, that so far as
laws and litigation are concerned, nothing remains but the
long road to Appomattox. Proud Virginia gazed upon the
voluntary desegregation of her schools with bitter distaste,
but in the end we were like Byron’s heroine who “vowing
she would ne’er consent, consented.” Defeat.</p>

<p>And yet; and yet. The fabric of the South is snagged with
a beggar’s lice of contradictions. The jesting exhortation that
the South will rise again has a hard kernel of truth at the
bottom. It is precisely because the South has experienced defeat,
again and again, in Nullification, in the Missouri compromise,
in the War, in Reconstruction, in the postwar generations,
time and again, in contradiction to the success of
our neighboring regions, that defeat has become an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
friend. We meet it, and survive; we rise again. And paradoxically,
the prospect of defeat in lunch counters, waiting rooms,
public schools, places of assembly, is no harbinger of ultimate
despair; the prospect is an old friend, the face of defeat,
and in the South it is a symbol not of disintegration but of
unity. Misery loves company. It does, indeed; oh, it does
indeed! And we are our own best company.</p>

<p>I speak with a mild cynicism, and do not mean to: It
floats to the surface. The mystical entity that is the South is
held together, in a lovely, helpless, hapless bond, by its consciousness
of the Negro, by its abiding conservatism, by its
dedication to romanticism, and by its inexorable sense of realities,
and whenever one of these threads wears thin, another
is redoubled and twice twined together to knit the fabric
whole. The defeated South is never wholly defeated; the romantic
South cannot be wholly disillusioned; the conservative
South can flirt with liberalism and remain as chastely conservative
as before; and to the twin inevitabilities of death
and taxes we philosophically add a third: the Negro, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
saecula saeculorum</i>, world without end. Amen.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Let me move on, may it please the court, with fewer digressions
and random interpolations, to the South’s case
against “integration.” The quotation marks are intended to
suggest that the noun has a distinctive meaning. This is as
good a place as any for a definition of terms.</p>

<p>Increasingly, in the Southern lexicon, words that are used
interchangeably elsewhere in the country have come to take
on a special and well-understood meaning. By “segregation,”
for example, we now mean the body of practices enforced
by State or local law. Prior to <em>Brown</em>, our schools were legally
segregated. As this is written (though probably not for
long), places of assembly, athletic contests, certain public
records, also are segregated by law in several States. As these
laws and institutions one by one are bowled over by court
decree, a process of <em>desegregation</em> sets in. It is an abominable
word, by any philological standpoint, as madly illogical as
“irregardless” or “inflammable,” but a new spirit of lexicography<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
is abroad in the land: Whatever is, is right. Our
schools, save in Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina,
are entering upon desegregation.</p>

<p>By racial <em>separation</em>, we mean something much less precise.
In almost every aspect of Southern life, the races are
separate, though not necessarily (or even very often) are
they segregated. Day in and day out, white and Negro inevitably
are thrown closely together in the South&mdash;shopping in
stores, working in factories, riding in elevators and buses,
standing in queues at banks or liquor stores or post offices&mdash;but
this is the normal condition of existence. I have termed
it an intimate remoteness. It is a condition that goes beyond
the ordinary impersonal encapsulation of strangers; it is a
subconscious recognition that ours are separate races, separate
worlds. This does not imply that there is no communication.
On the contrary, the Southern white and the Southern
Negro are gregarious animals; thrown temporarily together,
they will make agreeable conversation: “Think this rain will
ever stop?” “It suttinly is po’in, it is that.” This is the relationship
that conditions all human intercourse in the South.
A murder has been committed; the police reporter’s first
question, before he thinks of who or where or why or when,
is simply “white or colored?” A candidate qualifies for public
office: Is he white or colored? News values start from this
point. (Even as I write this paragraph, the telephone rings,
and it is an informant at the State penitentiary calling to tell
me that clemency has been granted a prisoner in death row.
I am not familiar with the case. “White boy or colored boy?”
I ask. Doubtless it makes no difference; they are equally
fallen sparrows, but the question is automatic, instinctive, inescapable.
It is a consequence of racial separation, and this
is a part of the world we live in.)</p>

<p>Finally, by way of definition, <em>integration</em> has come to mean
a willing suspension, or abolition, of the state of mind I attempt
to convey by <em>separation</em>. So defined, integration is almost
nonexistent in the South. The term embraces the complete
and unrestrained intermingling of races, on terms of
social equality, without constraint of any sort; it is color-blindness,
voluntarily accepted; it is more than mere joint
membership on civic committees or school boards. And it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
not something that can be achieved by writ of mandamus. A
court can impose a legal condition of desegregation, and thus
put an end to segregation; but a court cannot enjoin separation
and thus achieve integration. The arm of the law, long
as it is, cannot reach into certain areas of the human spirit.</p>

<p>It would be pointless, at this late stage, to prepare even a
hypothetical brief directed wholly against “desegregation.”
The desegregation of public institutions is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>.
True, the process is far from complete; in the Deep South,
in this late spring of 1962, the process has not even begun&mdash;and
I would not hazard a guess when it will begin, or be
complete. No time soon. But my thesis here is primarily the
South’s abhorrence of integration, and especially the South’s
continuing stubborn resistance to a widespread desegregation
of the public schools that fearfully would result in integration
of the races. Why is the South resisting race-mixture in its
public schools?</p>

<p>I am going to suggest three primary reasons. Other writers
about the South might put them down as five or ten or fifteen
reasons, but in the end perhaps we would cover the same
points. Mine are, first, the arguments of anthropology; second,
the arguments of practicality; and third, the arguments
for gradualism.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>On the first point: The South earnestly submits that over
a period of thousands of years, the Negro race, as a race, has
failed to contribute significantly to the higher and nobler
achievements of civilization as the West defines that term.
This may be a consequence of innate psychic factors. Again,
it may not be, but because contemporary evidence suggests
little racial improvement, the South prefers to cling to the
characteristics of the white race, as best it can, and to protect
those characteristics, as best it can, from what is sincerely
regarded as the potentially degrading influence of Negro
characteristics.</p>

<p>Now, that is a “racist” thesis, and if one would listen to no
more than the horrified gasps of the Liberal left, the very
statement is a dreadful example of racism at its worst. Hitlerism!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Fascism! Kluxism! White supremacy! To the doctrinaire
theologians of a Liberal socio-anthropology, the thesis is
blasphemy, and it is mortal sin even to consider it. A Group
for the Advancement of Psychiatry, in May 1957, denounced
such heresy in unequivocal terms: “The <em>fact</em> is, <em>of course</em>,
that the Negro possesses the same capacities and potentialities
as does the white.”</p>

<p>But if this is a <em>fact</em>, how did it get to be a fact? How “of
course”? Is the question of innate aptitudes and characteristics
no more arguable than the sum of two plus two? Is the
flat statement that “the Negro possesses the same capacities
and potentialities as the white” to be regarded on a level with
“Washington was the first President,” or “the square of the
hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the
square of its other two sides”? If this “fact” has in truth
been so positively established, discussion of the subject is
wholly pointless; nothing remains to be said, and those readers
whose minds are closed to reconsideration will flee from
these pages and soothe their wounded sensibilities with the
balm of Ashley Montagu’s hairless prose.</p>

<p>But those who are agreeable to pursuing truth, <em>wherever
the quest may lead them</em>, will stick around; they will keep
their minds open; they will acknowledge at least an outside
possibility that the disciples of Boas and Klineberg could be
in error; they will formulate questions, and they will insist
upon honest and straightforward answers to them. And if
intellectually satisfying answers to their questions cannot be
adduced, they will honestly acknowledge at the end: <em>The
question is still open.</em></p>

<p>Now, that is all the defense can ask. Few Southerners
have made any serious attempt to read up on anthropology
or to acquaint themselves with the results of intelligence
tests. Their judgments and attitudes&mdash;or if you please, their
prejudices&mdash;are based largely upon personal observation, instinct,
upbringing, the cumulative experiences of a lifetime,
stored up day by day and hour by hour. An advocate for
the South does not wish to be dogmatic. He does not insist
that the South has all the right answers. He does not say,
“the <em>fact</em> is, <em>of course</em>.” But the South does suggest that it
raises some of the right questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>

<p>Even to raise the right questions has become an almost
impossible undertaking in today’s emotionally charged atmosphere.
For the past twenty years at least (I write in 1962),
a systematic and well-financed campaign has been under way
to obliterate the entire concept of race. This calculated perversion
of honest scholarship has drawn a rebuke from Dr.
Carleton S. Coon, one of the world’s foremost anthropologists,
who himself believes that classification by race “is a
nuisance.” In <cite>The Story of Man</cite>, Coon departs from his masterly
narrative long enough to register a serious protest
against the activities “of the academic debunkers and soft-pedalers
who operate inside anthropology itself.”</p>

<p>“Basing their ideas on the concept of the brotherhood of
man,” Coon comments sharply, “certain writers, who are
mostly social anthropologists, consider it immoral to study
race, and produce book after book deploring it as a ‘myth.’
Their argument is that because the study of race once gave
ammunition to racial fascists, who misused it, we should
pretend that races do not exist. Their prudery about race is
equaled only by their horror of Victorian prudery about
sex. These writers are not physical anthropologists, but the
public does not know the difference.”</p>

<p>Typical of the doctrinaire Liberals who shrink from the
very notion of race are the scientists who make up the
Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. In their disdainful
view, race is no more than a “myth.” In particular, the
Group denounces the “myths which have grown up about
the Negro.” These “myths,” it is said, serve merely to rationalize
and to justify the white man’s disparaging attitudes,
because he cannot clearly recognize or understand the real
source of his prejudice. We should realize, says the Group,
that such “myth formation” psychologically seeks to protect
individual and group security; and if we realize that, we can
better understand why the “myths of prejudice” are so resistive
to logic: The powerful need for safety, which “the
myth” is created to insure, explains why it is clung to despite
facts and logic to the contrary. Moreover, the damaging
consequences of “racial myths” are misconstrued as evidence
to support them.</p>

<p>Ashley Montagu has suggested, in <cite>Human Heredity</cite>, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the very word <em>race</em> be struck from the English language.
There is, he says, “sound sense in the argument that the
long-standing abuse of the meaning of a word constitutes
the best reason for its total exclusion from common usage.”
Unsound words make for unsound ideas, and the unsound
ideas tend to result in unsound action: “The word ‘race’
is a horrid example.” To Dr. Montagu, race is a notion,
a myth, a fallacy, an error. In the sense that the term
suggests distinguishing characteristics on the part of a particular
people, “the word is beyond rescue and it had better
be dropped altogether.” He suggests that the term “ethnic
group” be employed instead, and the most he will concede
is that “slight differences may exist between some ethnic
groups in the frequencies of certain genes underlying mental
capacity.” This is possible, says Dr. Montagu, “but in spite
of all attempts, no one has, in fact, ever demonstrated that
they do.”</p>

<p>Otto Klineberg, who cannot bring himself to write the
words <em>race</em> or <em>racial</em> without putting them in quotation marks,
says the same thing: “In all probability, inherent intellectual
differences between Negroes and whites do not exist.” Other
writers&mdash;Kenneth Clark and Ruth Benedict, for example&mdash;are
impatient with such academic impedimenta as “probabilities.”
More in anger than in sorrow, they denounce the
bigoted Southerner, who dares to suggest that in terms of
his capacity to adjust fully to Western values, the Negro
may be innately inferior. The very idea! And any recourse
by the Southerner to history, as Miss Benedict puts it, is
mere “special pleading.” All good historians know of the
greatness of Negro achievements. To doubt this truth is to
substitute for historical processes “an unashamed racial
megalomania.” This is a “travesty of fact.”</p>

<p>In 1960, a group of distinguished anthropologists, psychologists,
and social scientists, rebelling against the obstinate
attitudes of the Benedict-Montagu school, launched a small
publication in Edinburgh, <cite>The Mankind Quarterly</cite>. They
ventured to suggest that some of these questions of “race”
are not altogether closed; they commented that it was a
pity to see responsible scientists so influenced by emotion
and political bias that they had closed their minds to objective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
inquiry; and the editors proposed to publish occasional
monographs exploring aspects of these issues that were
banned from exploration elsewhere. <cite>Mankind Quarterly</cite>
scarcely had raised its mild voice before shrill cries from
the Liberal left united in a ritual chorus of denunciation.
Late in 1961, the chief editor, Dr. R. Gayre of Gayre, replied
to his assailants in an editorial that sums up so much
of the Southern view on these matters that I should like to
quote from it at some length. He began by expressing
regret that persons who do not slavishly subscribe to egalitarian
dogmas should be denounced automatically as “racialists”
and their teachings condemned as “racism.” He continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The fear of being so abused has for the last one or
two decades been sufficient to silence many, if not most,
scholars and prevent them from writing what they believed
and thought to be the facts in connection with anthropological
subjects. They have, in the main, confined themselves
to negative action, such as protesting when the
notorious UNESCO pamphlet on race was produced, and
being happy to gain, as a result, some modification of the
more extreme and nonsensical assertions of the a-racist
egalitarians.</p>

<p>That there has been such a clearly marked reactionary
influence, if not domination, over our studies, is so patently
obvious that it hardly needs to be stressed. Even those
who have not subscribed to any form of political doctrine
have felt it safer to make interpretations of the facts of
race and heredity in such terms that they can bear a
clearly egalitarian interpretation.... The anxiety which is
shown to suppress publications and expositions which do
not support egalitarianism is entirely consistent with this
political direction of, and domination over, science....</p>

<p>[W]e wish to state categorically what are the views
of the editors on the matter of racial equality. While rejecting
racial egalitarianism as having no warranty in
honest scientific expositions and investigations, we do not,
on the other hand, subscribe to doctrines of racial <em>superiority</em>
or <em>inferiority</em>. We believe that just as all individuals
within a particular stock are different, so is one racial group
in relation to another. In respect of some characters,
various stocks will be superior to others; and in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
cases inferior; but in many cases no perceptible differences
may be apparent. While environment, both physical and
social, may influence these characters, we believe that
heredity is by far the most important single factor, and
the current fashion to eschew the significance of heredity
is a definite disservice to the understanding of what makes
for differences in the various characters which distinguish
one group from another.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we do not presume to judge what is
desirably superior or not. We think that within the ambit
of the type of civilizations erected by the White-Brown
stocks or the Yellow races, the Black, which has shown
no natural predilection to that form of organization, will
be at a disadvantage in any competition&mdash;and is <em>in that
sense</em> inferior. After all, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">priori</i> considerations alone would
lead to this conclusion, and if modern science thinks this
is not the case, it has yet to show why and how the
Melanoids have remained technologically backward compared
to both the Mongoloids and the Caucasoids. For
the Egyptian civilization, which was basically Caucasoid
(Mediterranean, Atlantic, Nordic, and Armenoid strains
being the basis of that nationality), abutted on the Negroid
world of Africa, and its ideas were there to be accepted
and copied, so that urban technological civilizations could
have been erected in Africa, if that way of life had appealed
to the inherent Negroid genius and temperament.
It is only within this last millennium that certain ideas
generated in Egypt four millennia ago began to reach
West Africa&mdash;long after the Nile Valley civilization had
decayed and disappeared.</p>
</div>

<p>H. L. Mencken once remarked that the most costly of
all follies, which he viewed as the chief occupation of mankind,
is to believe passionately in the palpably not true. The
aphorism applies with special force to the Negrophile social
anthropologists who are so passionately determined to propound
that which is palpably not true, or at least palpably
not demonstrable, that in their zeal of advocacy they lose
all sense of proportion. Thus, in their raptures, the most
primitive mud-hut cultures of the Congo must be praised for
their “sophistication” and “complexity.” Crude works of art
tend to be equated with the sculpture of Periclean Athens.
In the rhythmic thump of an African tom-tom, they find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
black Beethovens at work. Miss Benedict, in <cite>Race: Science
and Politics</cite>, is fairly transported. Her technicolor illusions
of African history produce “great kingdoms of wealth and
splendor ... great political leaders ... men of wealth ... the
spread of higher culture.” In seventeenth-century Nigeria,
she sees “prized cultural achievements,” and of these African
tribes she girlishly cries that “their elaborate and ceremonious
political organization, the pomp of their courts, the activity
of their far-flung economic life, with its great market
centers and tribute collected over great areas, their legal
systems with formal trial of the accused, with witnesses and
with prosecutors&mdash;all these excite the admiration of any
student.”</p>

<p>Well, one is reminded of Mark Twain’s comment that
there is something fascinating about science: “One gets
such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling
investment of fact.” Let it be granted that there is much of
archeological and anthropological interest to be found in the
obscure and sketchy “histories” of various African kingdoms
and empires. One might wish, abstractly, to know more of
the Ghana Empire, the Almoravid Empire, the Mali Empire,
the Songhai Empire; the teachers and the curriculum and
the libraries of the Universities of Timbuktu and Sakoré
might usefully be contrasted with those of the Universities
of Paris and Bologna; we should like standard reference
works that offered full and scholarly expositions of the
kingdom Miss Benedict terms the “culmination” of African
civilization, the “great empire of Bornu.” It is an empire not
even mentioned by Herskovits in <cite>The Myth of the Negro
Past</cite> and barely touched upon by J. D. DeGraft Johnson
and W. E. B. DuBois in their works on African civilization.
(DuBois does say that Bornu, a Northern Nigerian kingdom,
had in the tenth century a civilization that “would appear
to compare favorably with that of European monarchs of
that day.” It is an assessment that leaves very little to the
Carolingians, and it is the sort of tossed-off grandiloquence
of the Negrophile propagandist that leaves the ordinary
student more mystified than informed.)</p>

<p>In terms of enduring values&mdash;the kind of values respected
wherever scholars gather, in the East no less than in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
West&mdash;in terms of values that last, and mean something,
and excite universal admiration and respect, what has man
gained from the history of the Negro race? The answer, alas,
“virtually nothing.” From the dawn of civilization to the
middle of the twentieth century, the Negro race, as a race,
has contributed no more than a few grains of sand to the
enduring monuments of mankind.</p>

<p>One finds no pleasure in rendering such a judgment; one
finds no more than the cold comfort of truth, and even that
chilly companion is made the less attractive by the disdain
in which this unappealing truth is held. Yet the serious
students of the South’s position, like the serious pathologist
examining an especially distasteful object, ought not to be
deterred. If the South is wrong in this appraisal of the contributions
of the Negro race (or “culture,” or “ethnic
group”), then evidence of this wrongness should be readily
attainable in standard works of reference; such evidence
should be convincingly documented, objective in its nature,
susceptible of proof by accepted tests of scholarship.</p>

<p>Well, then, where is this contrary evidence? What library
houses the works of a Nubian Thucydides? Who was the
Senegalese Cicero? One plows in vain through the works of
a score of apologists. In the volumes of the most sympathetic
Negrophile writers, one finds little but conjecture, surmise,
vague assertions that thus and so “must have been true.” What
are the contributions of the Negro culture to enduring art, or
music, or literature, or architecture? To law, jurisprudence,
government? To science, invention, mathematics, philosophy?
Here was a race, if the horrid word may be used (or a
culture or subculture or ethnic group), that lived for thousands
of years in effective possession of one of the richest
continents on earth. Here were a people who lived by the
sea, and never conceived the sail; who dwelled in the midst of
fantastic mineral deposits, and contrived no more than the
crudest smelting of iron and copper. The Negro developed no
written language, not even the poorest hieroglyphics; no
poetry; no numerals; not even a calendar that has survived.
Even so skilled a defender as Toynbee has to conclude, after
a desperate flurry of coughs and sighs, that the Black Race is
the only one of the primary races “which has not made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
creative contribution to any one of our twenty-one civilizations.”
Breasted, who wrote in a more objective time, before
fashions of social ideology tended to warp critical judgment,
says bluntly that “the Negro peoples of Africa were without
any influence on the development of early civilization.”</p>

<p>Franz Boas, the father of “modern” social anthropology,
posed the South’s question in this fashion in <cite>The Mind of
Primitive Man</cite>: “Have not most races had the same chances
for development? Why, then, did the white race alone develop
a civilization which is sweeping the whole world, and compared
with which all other civilizations appear as feeble beginnings
cut short in early childhood, or arrested and petrified
at an early stage of development? Is it not, to say the least,
probable that the race which attained the highest stage of civilization
was the most gifted one, and that those races which
have remained at the bottom of the scale were not capable
of rising to higher levels?”</p>

<p>Boas’ answer to his own rhetorical question, needless to say,
is that most races have not had the same chances for development,
that “the claim that achievement and aptitude go hand
in hand is not convincing,” and that “the earlier rise of civilization
in the old world ... is satisfactorily explained as due
to chance.” He finds nothing to persuade him that “one race is
more highly gifted than another,” and besides, he insists, Western
critics ought not to judge other races by their own standards.
For example, an “impression” exists that primitive men,
and the less educated of our own race, have in common a
lack of control of emotions; it is thought that they give way
more readily to an impulse than civilized man and the highly
educated. This impression, says Boas, is entirely unjustified.
Too often the traveler or student measures fickleness by the
importance he himself attributes to the actions or purposes in
which primitive men do not persevere, and he weighs the
impulse for outbursts of passion by his own standard. The
white traveler, to whom time is valuable, is impatient and
irritated at Negro porters, to whom time means nothing. The
proper way to appraise the Negro, Boas tells us, is to consider
his behavior in undertakings which he considers important
from his own standpoint. So considered, the differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
in attitude of civilized man and of primitive man tend to
disappear.</p>

<p>This line of defense has a certain plausibility and merit;
divorced from reality, it provides a fine topic for a sophomore’s
term paper. But the American South is an inheritor of
Western civilization; the South’s values are the values of the
West, and it understandably must be concerned with the capacity
of the Negro people for contributing to these values.
The Ubangi’s mud huts may be the most artistic mud huts
ever set out in the sun to bake; by tribal esthetics of the
African bush, the Ashanti may be vastly more cultured than
the Yorubas, and the Balubi superior to the Mogwandi. Or
vice versa. These critical judgments are interesting. They are
irrelevant, too.</p>

<p>The question that never seems to be convincingly answered
is <em>why</em> the Negro race, in Toynbee’s phrase, is the only race
that has failed to make a creative contribution to civilization.
What can account for the singular failure of the Negro people,
alone among the major divisions of man, to enter the mainstream
of political, cultural, and economic history?</p>

<p>The first rationalization that is given is that the physical
conditions of sub-Saharan Africa imposed such fearful disadvantages
that the development of a “civilization” was patently
impossible. The argument simply will not hold up. As many
geographers and anthropologists have observed (in a day before
such observations were reviewed as blasphemy), parts of
Africa were perhaps “uninhabitable,” but other parts were not.
In any event, the jungles of the Congo imposed no obstacles
to Negroid peoples greater than those faced by the Mayans in
the jungles of Chiapas.</p>

<p>And consider the Mayans: They carved out of the rain
forests of Yucatán&mdash;out of an area Van Hagen has termed
“the least likely place one would choose for developing a
culture”&mdash;a civilization that can be identified, and studied, and
photographed to this day. They raised great temple cities:
Tikal, Uaxactun, Calakmul. They built roads and reservoirs.
They developed complex ideographic writing, a twenty-day
lunar calendar, a code of laws for crime and punishment, a
flourishing industry in dyeing and weaving. To compare the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
crude phallic fetishism of Negroid tribes with the highly developed
art of the Mayan and the Incan civilizations is to
engage in a travesty upon critical judgment.</p>

<p>It is complained of the early Negroes that they were “isolated,”
that no maritime access was possible to the African
interior, hence that they had no opportunity for contact with
the cultures of Europe and the Mediterranean. This is a specious
argument, too. Every standard history of Africa makes
plain, implicitly or explicitly, that early Negroes did indeed
have contact with the outer world. Phoenicians, Arabs,
Libyans, Hamites all found their way across Africa. Romans
came, and Persians, Chinese, Turks, Berbers, Indians, Portuguese.
Nothing aroused the Negro from his primitive sleep.
He did not adapt. He did not copy. He did not profit.</p>

<p>In 1525, when Pizarro invaded Peru, he found a magnificent
Incan civilization flourishing in the almost impenetrable
fastness of the Andes. Here, indeed, was isolation from the
currents of European thought! No maritime access here! Yet
the Incas had built temples and labyrinths and massive palaces
of stone. The palace at Cuzco offered fountains, heated pools,
intricate goldwork, and polished stones. There were public
granaries, a three-hundred-mile road, a decimal system, an
advanced astronomy. European explorers who sought trade
in Africa found nothing there to compare with this. As Nathaniel
Weyl has written, the decisive fact is that centuries of
intermittent contact with the growing culture and technology
of the West “did not serve to stir the Negroes from their
millennial torpor, to quicken their minds and prod their curiosity,
to induce them at least to borrow if not to invent.”</p>

<p>Franz Boas has sought earnestly to explain all this away.
So has Basil Davidson in <cite>Lost Cities of Africa</cite>. So has W. E.
B. DuBois in <cite>The World and Africa</cite>. So has Johnson in <cite>African
Glory</cite>. But when it comes down to evidence acceptable to
rational appraisal, their romantic conjectures fall pitifully short
of the minimum requirements of objective scholarship. It is
possible to accept Boas’ judgment that some African wood
carvers and potters have produced work “original in form,
and executed with great care.” Coon’s slightly more enthusiastic
appraisal is that Africa’s Negro tribes “developed social
systems of considerable complexity and a high art, the quality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
of which the white world is just beginning to appreciate.”
There is merit in a thoughtful appraisal by the Oxford anthropologist,
E. E. Evans-Pritchard, of the complex system of
witchcraft, oracles, and magic that he found among the Azande
tribe of Central Africa. <em>Granted certain postulates</em>, he says,
inferences and actions based upon a system of witchcraft are
sound. But is Western civilization really prepared to “grant
the certain postulates” of witchcraft in order to find a rationale
for praising African culture? No. Let it be conceded
that certain African arts and crafts reached a tolerably
interesting stage of development. Modern dance and contemporary
jazz doubtless owe much to the instinctive
rhythms of ancient tribal rites. But south of the Sahara
there was no literate civilization, no intellects at work to
comprehend and solve the abstract problems; and Western
Europe was not built by basket-weaving.</p>

<p>Let us move along. The story is told of a conversation between
Boswell and Dr. Johnson, in which Boswell mentioned
Bishop Berkeley’s theory of the nonexistence of matter. Boswell
said he was satisfied the theory was not true, but he
confessed he was unable to refute it. Whereupon Dr. Johnson
kicked a large stone until his foot rebounded from it. “I refute
it <em>thus</em>,” he said. There comes a time when the common, uncomplicated
observation of ordinary men makes better sense
than the partisan inventions of social anthropologists. Against
their gauzy dreams of African “civilization,” the obscenities
of the Mau Mau and the atrocities of the Congolese provide
reality as hard as Dr. Johnson’s stone. One refutes it <em>thus</em>.</p>

<p>In 1944, Otto Klineberg brought together in one volume
several of the monographs prepared by American students on
the Negro as background memoranda for Dr. Gunnar Myrdal,
the Swedish sociologist whose subsequent <cite>An American Dilemma</cite>
was to be seen generally, and influentially, by the
Supreme Court of the United States. The first paper in Klineberg’s
collection was put together by Dr. Guy B. Johnson,
professor of sociology and anthropology at the University of
North Carolina. Dr. Johnson served for three years as executive
director of the liberal Southern Regional Council; he is
a trustee of Howard University. These credentials strongly
suggest that Dr. Johnson was picked by the Myrdal team to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
describe “the Stereotype of the American Negro” on the assumption
that he would summarize the popular conception of
the Negro only to say, in the end, that there isn’t a word of
truth in it. If so, the Myrdal associates must have been startled
by the blunt memorandum Dr. Johnson prepared. He went
through the works of thirty-one representative Negro writers
and forty-two representative white writers, covering the entire
spectrum of political coloration, and boiled down his findings
under twelve headings. His list, he emphasized, was not a list
of “race” characteristics. It was “a descriptive list, based upon
a fair degree of consensus, of the interests, habits and tendencies
which might serve to characterize the ‘typical’ Negro.”
This list of “Negro personality and culture traits” follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Mental</em>: Relatively low intellectual interests; good memory;
facile associations of ideas.</p>

<p><em>Temperamental</em>: Gregariousness or high interest in social
contacts; philosophical or get-the-most-out-of-life type of
adjustment; high aesthetic interests; love of subtlety and
indirection; adaptability.</p>

<p><em>Aesthetic</em>: Love of music and dance; oratory and power
of self-expression; high interest in and appreciation of the
artistic.</p>

<p><em>Economic</em>: Relatively low interest in material things, such
as care of money, property, tools, etc.; line of least resistance
in habits of work; relative lack of self-reliance.</p>

<p><em>Personal morals</em>: Double standard of morals and ethics,
i.e., one for his behavior toward Negroes and another for
his behavior toward whites; in sexual conduct, higher interest
in sex, high sexual indulgence, and larger sphere of
permissive sexual relations.</p>

<p><em>Family and home life</em>: Relatively low solidarity; high frequency
of common-law matings and separations; role of
mother strong; warmth of affection toward children; high
rate of illegitimacy.</p>

<p><em>Religion and the supernatural</em>: Rather high emotional
tone; personalization of God and saints; high interest in
“superstition”&mdash;i.e., belief in various supernatural forces
and ways of controlling them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p><em>Law observance</em>: Relatively high incidence of social disorder;
drunkenness, fighting, gambling, petty stealing, etc.;
resentment against the white man’s law.</p>

<p><em>Public manners</em>: Tendency toward extroversion in public
contact; easy sociability, loud talk; relative carelessness in
speech and dress.</p>

<p><em>Race pride</em>: Not yet highly developed; inferiority feelings
common; acceptance of white standards of physical beauty
to a large extent.</p>

<p><em>Race consciousness and leadership</em>: Lack of cohesion;
high intragroup conflict and cleavage; distrust of leaders;
lack of strong race-wide leadership.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, what does Dr. Johnson say about this Negro “stereotype”?
Insofar as the list of characteristics has any validity, he
comments, it is more applicable to the Negro masses than to
the minority of highly sophisticated and acculturated Negroes.
But how much validity does it have? Here was the shocker.
For Dr. Johnson himself noted that these same characteristics
had been attributed to the Negro by both white and Negro
writers; and this being so, “there is more than a slight presumption
in favor of the reality of the characteristics.” He
suggested that the Myrdal associates “assume that after all
there is <em>some</em> truth or basis of reality to the traits which are
persistently mentioned in literature and in popular thinking.”</p>

<p>“It is true,” Dr. Johnson remarked, “that the whole trend of
scholarship at present is to look upon the traits which the
dominant group attributes to a minority group as nothing
more than stereotypes which have been invented for the express
purpose of justifying the position of the dominant group
and controlling the status of the subordinate group. These
stereotypes are sometimes referred to as myths, the implication
being that they have no realistic basis whatever. It should be
pointed out, however, that it is probably not necessary for a
dominant group such as the white people in America, to invent
and perpetuate stereotypes which are wholly unfair and untrue
in order to maintain its own status of dominance.... The
point here being made, which is simple and which rests upon
a common-sense assumption, is that the stereotypes which a
dominant group develops concerning the traits of a subordinate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
group will be to some extent based upon observable
characteristics in the subordinate group, and that while the
stereotypes may be permeated with prejudice and with the
ideology of inferiority, <em>they may still reflect a certain amount
of truth concerning the subordinate group</em>. In other words, if
we can deduct from the popular stereotypes the moral judgments
and the implications of inferiority and the exaggerations,
we may have left a body of belief which affords
considerable insight into the traits of the subordinate group.”
[Emphasis added.]</p>

<p>The Johnson list goes to the very heart of the South’s resistance
to the desegregation of its public schools. When it is
asked why the South opposes integration, one might provide
a tolerably complete answer simply by citing Dr. Johnson’s
twelve summary findings: <em>This is why.</em> The most Dr. Johnson
will say of the “stereotype” is that it contains a “certain
amount of truth.” In my own observation, and in the observation
of the white South generally, the list contains a vast
amount of truth. I would dissent from the Johnson findings on
a couple of points only: I doubt that the “Negro masses” (any
more than the white masses) have a “high interest in and appreciation
of the artistic,” and it seems to me the summary
of the Negro’s typical “public manners” is overdrawn. Since
1943, when Dr. Johnson prepared his summary, a phenomenal
growth has taken place in a Negro middle class, and much of
the “loud talk” and “relative carelessness in speech and dress”
has given way to cultivated speech and to a certain elegance
in dress. In my observation, the colored children of Richmond
frequently are cleaner, shinier, and more neatly dressed than
many of their white counterparts.</p>

<p>In general, however, this purported “stereotype” provides an
accurate and faithful mold of typical Negro behavior and personality.
Are these traits a consequence of racial inheritance?
The overwhelmingly popular view of anthropologists, social
and physical, is that these are <em>not</em> innate characteristics. The
entire school of Franz Boas, embraced by Kluckhohn, Benedict,
Klineberg, Clark, Rose, Comas, Montagu, and many
others, holds firmly, and in some cases almost hysterically, that
whatever lags may be observed in typically Negro culture, as
contrasted with typically white culture, these shortcomings are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
entirely owing to environment. As the Group for the Advancement
of Psychiatry puts it, “these handicaps are a consequence
of racial discrimination rather than of racial inferiority.”</p>

<p>The view, however, is not unanimous, nor is the manner in
which these “environmental” views are advanced universally
acclaimed.</p>

<p>“If we in America are going to make any sense out of the
Supreme Court’s desegregation decision,” Dr. Frank C. J.
McGurk has remarked, “we will have to be more factual
about race differences and much less emotional. We can have
our dreams, if we like to dream, but we should be willing to
distinguish between dreams and reality. Already, we have gone
too far toward confusing these two things. As far as psychological
differences between Negroes and whites are concerned,
we have wished&mdash;and dreamed that there were no such differences.
We have identified this wish with reality, and on it
we have established a race relations policy that was so clearly
a failure that we had to appeal to distorting propaganda for
its support.... There is ample evidence that there are psychological
differences between Negroes and whites. Moreover,
these differences are, today, of about the same magnitude as
they were two generations ago. These differences are not the
result of differences in social and economic opportunities, and
they will not disappear as the social and economic opportunities
of Negroes and whites are equalized.”</p>

<p>Dr. McGurk is associate professor of psychology at Villanova.
The quotation comes from his famous (or infamous,
depending on one’s point of view) article in <cite>U. S. News &amp;
World Report</cite> of September 21, 1956. Several years later, Dr.
McGurk provided an introduction for Nathaniel Weyl’s <cite>The
Negro in American Civilization</cite>, in which he expanded briefly
on the same theme. Weyl’s book, published by Public Affairs
Press in 1960, is an almost indispensable work to the student
of this subject who is sincerely interested in getting “both
sides.” (Another valuable work, also published by Public
Affairs Press, is Carleton Putnam’s <cite>Race and Reason: A
Yankee View</cite>; Putnam has driven the Liberal anthropologists
practically to apoplexy by the unfair tactic of reading their
works and taking them seriously&mdash;something no layman is
expected to do. The rule is that non-anthropologists must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
treat anthropologists respectfully, even when anthropologists
write nonsense). Like Putnam, Weyl was raised and educated
in the integrated North. He set out to write his book with
Northern preconceptions; but the more deeply he dug for
facts, the more he discovered that “material which passed
for the objective findings of social scientists could more
accurately be characterized as rationalizations and propaganda
wearing academic cap and gown.” He demonstrated
the intellectual courage to abandon his preconceived ideas,
and to conclude after an exhaustive study that “the presumption
is strongly in favor of innate psychic differences.”</p>

<p>In his introduction, Dr. McGurk describes Weyl’s book as
a refreshing antidote to the one-sided, environmentalist argumentation
that is all most college students ever receive, and
he goes on to urge that from the standpoint of the scientist,
the problem of race should be studied in an objective manner:
“Appeals to beliefs, morals, ethics, or political philosophy are
out of place; the issue is one of fact.... Ethnic differences are
facts. In the psychic area, these differences are important facts.
It seems much more sane to face these differences and investigate
their causes impartially than to play ostrich about them.”</p>

<p>Let us go back, for a moment, to Dr. Johnson’s “stereotype.”
Manifestly, many of the characteristics he finds most
widely attributed to the Negro are incapable of statistical
measurement. Empirical data could not well be compiled, for
example, on “relative lack of self-reliance,” or “love of subtlety
and indirection.” But one characteristic found to be more typical
of the Negro than of the white is “high sexual indulgence,
larger sphere of permissive sexual relations, ... and high rate
of illegitimacy.” The illegitimacy, at least, can be statistically
tabulated, and the appalling facts can be faced.</p>

<p>What are the facts? First, the illegitimacy rate among Negroes
in this country is roughly <em>ten times</em> the illegitimacy rate
among whites. Second, the condition is not improving, but on
the contrary appears in many areas to be growing worse.
Third, a disproportionately high rate of illegitimacy among
Negroes obtains not only in the South, but throughout the
United States.</p>

<p>These are the grim figures from the National Office of Vital
Statistics:</p>

<p class="p2">The U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare
periodically releases data on the nation as a whole. The
figures for 1957 illustrate the story. In that year, 1.9 per
cent of all white births were illegitimate; 21.7 per cent of
all Negro births were illegitimate. Negro illegitimacy ran
as high as 27.9 per cent in St. Louis, 29.3 per cent in
Atlanta, and 34.6 per cent in Knoxville. The influx of
Negroes into Washington, D. C., has given the nation’s
capital, to the nation’s shame, what the Washington <cite>Post</cite>
has termed “undisputed first place in illegitimacy.” In 1957,
nearly 19 per cent of all births recorded in the District of
Columbia were illegitimate&mdash;5.8 per cent of the whites and
26.5 per cent of the Negroes.</p>

<p>Now, a widespread custom among Negro apologists is
to scoff these figures away. It is said, for one thing, that
there is “a relatively greater understatement of illegitimacy
in the white group than in the nonwhite.” For my own part,
I doubt this exceedingly. It is said, also, that a greater percentage
of extramarital pregnancies are aborted among white
girls than among Negro girls. Perhaps. A third line of
rationalization typically has been advanced by the <cite>Norfolk
Journal and Guide</cite>, a Negro newspaper; this has to do with
the fact that slaves were not permitted to marry prior to
1865, though they were encouraged to cohabit, and “it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
foolish to suppose that a suppressed and constantly vilified
minority group could wholly recover from the practice in
a few generations.” A related argument, if it is an argument
at all, is that in pre-War times “many white slave-owners
promiscuously exploited their slave women sexually.” Other
rationalizations put some of the blame for Negro sexual
looseness on housing, economic opportunity, low income
levels, and the like. Generally, it is all charged to the
“system of segregation,” a charge that tends to collapse when
it is observed that the high rates of Negro illegitimacy recorded
in the South are not materially different in the integrated
climes of Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri,
and West Virginia.</p>

<p>But the basic validity of the statistics is not entirely discounted,
even by Negro commentators. Carl Rowan, the
Minneapolis newspaperman who came to the State Department
with the New Frontier, faced up to them (after a
good deal of preliminary squirming) in <cite>Harper’s</cite> in 1961.
A leading Negro educator, President Thomas H. Henderson
of Virginia Union University, offered some thoughtful comments
in a paper delivered before the Virginia Conference
of Social Work in 1957. He said:</p>

<p>“Let me begin by saying what the problem of a high
illegitimacy rate among Negroes is not. It is not, first of all,
a statistical illusion.... [T]he illegitimacy rate for Virginia
Negroes has been ten times as high as that for whites each
year for several decades. After subducting the maximum influence
of all possible sources of error in the statistics, the
consistency and magnitude of the differential leaves no doubt
that a real and disturbing difference exists.”</p>

<p>The problem cannot be blamed, said Dr. Henderson, on
any particular desire to obtain public benefits under the
program of Aid to Dependent Children. Moreover, “it is
not to any great degree a problem of racial interbreeding&mdash;every
indication points to a steady decrease in interbreeding
since before the dawn of this century.” The problem is
“overwhelmingly a problem of illegitimacy with both parents
colored.” He added:</p>

<p>“The problem is not the result of innate differences between
the races. It would be less painful if it were. If the
Negro had innate moral weakness or blindness, if he had an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
innately inferior intelligence, or in some inborn way either
his sex drive or his fertility were somehow different, we
could shrug off the problem by saying, ‘God made it that
way; there’s nothing to do about it.’ But we are faced with
the hard fact that reputable scientists regard as fruitless all
efforts to find valid evidence of any innate moral weakness
of the Negro or any innate difference in personality, intelligence,
or sexual behavior.”</p>

<p>Dr. Henderson went on in his paper to summarize many
of the mitigating factors earlier mentioned, including socio-economic
status, recreational limitations, inadequate sex
education within Negro families and schools, and the tensions
generated by discrimination. But he suspected that
these various factors together do not account for more than
half the problem: “Without a statistically valid basis for it,
my opinion is strong that the primary factor is that of motivation.
<em>The simple fact is that many Negro boys and girls do
not want strongly enough to avoid producing illegitimate
children.</em> The rank and file of those who are at the lowest
social levels have not changed their attitude to illegitimacy
since the days of slavery when sexual laxness in Negroes was
tolerated and even encouraged.” [Emphasis supplied.]</p>

<p>A notable comment along that line appeared in the St.
Louis <cite>Evening Whirl</cite>, a Negro newspaper, early in 1960,
in an account of a colored woman who complained, after
giving birth to her ninth illegitimate child, that her allowance
under Aid to Dependent Children had been cut from $185
to $110 a month. She felt “discriminated against.” Said the
<cite>Whirl</cite> editorially:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mrs. Brown thinks that she is entitled to live a normal
life with a boyfriend and not have to waste money running
around hotels and rooming houses. They can’t afford it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown is young and normal. She is only 29. She
cannot stop having a boyfriend and romance now. She
believes that poor people are entitled to social pleasures
and normal living.</p>

<p>This newspaper agrees with this version of living. The
rich have everything they want. Why can’t poor people
have a little fun? A lot of our foolish laws need changing.
We do not condemn Mrs. Brown. We rather praise
her. She is living proof of a good woman&mdash;one who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
promulgating her race.</p>

<p>When our race increases in number to a much larger
extent, we can demand more, get more, and show our
power and authority at the polls.</p>
</div>

<p>This remarkable attitude, which views the sexual act as
casually as a good-night kiss, is reported by school administrators
and law-enforcement officials among Negroes across
the nation. In Philadelphia, District Attorney Victor H. Blanc
in 1958 typically reported confiscation of large quantities of
pornographic pictures among Negro pupils in the public
schools; much of the material was intended to encourage
interracial “Sex Clubs” led by Negro teen-agers who regard
fornication, in the Negro newspaper’s phrase, as “social
pleasures and normal living.”</p>

<p>Another of Dr. Johnson’s characteristics, in the list that
made up his “stereotype” of the typical Negro, was summarized
under “law observance” as “relatively high incidence
of social disorder; drunkenness, fighting, gambling, petty
stealing, etc.” Here, too, some measurable data may be had.
Nathaniel Weyl has summed up the picture succinctly:</p>

<p>“For well over a century the Negro has been responsible
for an alarmingly disproportionate share of American crime.
In 1950 his felony rate was almost three times the national
average. Thirty per cent of the two million persons arrested
for major crimes in 1957 were colored.</p>

<p>“While his contribution to all types of crime, except
political crime, has been excessive, the Negro has gravitated
toward the most serious offenses and, above all, toward
crimes of violence. In recent years he has accounted for
<em>well over half</em> the nation’s murders, non-negligent manslaughters,
aggravated assaults and robberies.” [Emphasis
supplied.]</p>

<p>As in the case of illegitimacy, Negro crime rates have
not tended to decline significantly with the Negro’s rising
level of income and opportunity. About 34 per cent of the
convicts committed to jail in 1910 were colored; the figure
is about 30 per cent for 1960. Historically, Negro crime
rates have been higher in the more-or-less-integrated North
than in the more-or-less-segregated South. In Philadelphia,
where the shockingly brutal murder of a Korean student in
1958 prompted some candid and critical investigations, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
was found that Negro teen-agers, representing 30 per cent
of the population, were guilty of 75 per cent of juvenile
crime. In one nineteen-day period given special study,
Negroes were found responsible for forty-five of fifty-three
“headings,” in which victims were savagely beaten with clubs
and iron pipes; they also were charged with thirty-two of
thirty-eight murders and 340 of 437 cases of aggravated
assault. Eighty per cent of the inmates of Philadelphia prisons
at that time were Negroes. The figures are entirely comparable
in New York, where one city magistrate, after hearing
an unusually shocking case of Negro violence, asked
a rhetorical question that hangs quivering in the air: “What
kind of animals do we have in this town?”</p>

<p>But the problem of disproportionate criminality among
Negroes is not peculiar to Harlem or South Chicago or
Philadelphia, nor is it an especially new problem. Between
1930 and 1959, when Negroes represented about 10 per cent
of the population, Negroes made up 54 per cent of those
executed for crimes. And in a typical year, substantially
similar figures are reported across the nation. The FBI’s
<cite>Uniform Crime Reports</cite> for 1960 provide these figures on
arrests for major crimes in 2446 cities having a population
of 73,473,000:</p>

<p class="p2">When it is kept in mind that the cities included in the
FBI reports constitute a fair random sample, North and
South, small towns and large, the sobering nature of these
figures becomes apparent.</p>

<p>What can explain this dismaying tendency of the Negro
toward disproportionate criminality? The same rationalizations
(with a few ludicrous variations) are trotted out that
are produced to discredit the figures on illegitimacy. Gunnar
Myrdal devoted twelve pages of <cite>An American Dilemma</cite> to
scoffs, sneers, apologies, explanations, highflown fabrications,
and wildly speculative generalities, all intended to whitewash
the Negro record.</p>

<p>First, says Myrdal, the statistics are no good. Figures on
crime are generally inadequate, and statistics on Negro crime
are even more so. Such data generally suffer from incomplete
and inaccurate reporting, variations among States in
definitions and classifications; and in the case of the Negro,
the figures are distorted by special weaknesses owing to the
caste situation and to certain characteristics of the Negro
population. “It happens that Negroes are seldom in a position
to commit ... white collar crimes [such as tax evasion, conspiracy
to violate antitrust laws, fraud and racketeering]; they
commit the crimes which much more frequently result in
apprehension and punishment.” This is a chief source of
error when attempting to compare statistics on Negro and
white crime.</p>

<p>Myrdal then paints a picture of the South no Southerner
would recognize. For a jaw-dropping example of the strange
fabrications that have made Myrdal’s work notorious, consider
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the South, inequality of justice seems to be the most
important factor in making the statistics on Negro crime
and white crime not comparable: ... [I]n any crime which
remotely affects a white man, Negroes are more likely to
be arrested than are whites, more likely to be indicted after
arrest, more likely to be convicted in court and punished.
Negroes will be arrested on the slightest suspicion, or on
no suspicion at all, merely to provide witnesses or to work
during a labor shortage in violation of anti-peonage laws.
The popular belief that all Negroes are inherently criminal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
operates to increase arrests, and the Negro’s lack of political
power prevents <ins class="corr" id="tn-67" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'a white policemen'">
a white policeman</ins> from worrying about
how many Negro arrests he makes. Some white criminals
have made use of these prejudices to divert suspicion away
from themselves onto Negroes: for example, there are
many documented cases of white robbers blackening their
faces when committing crimes. In the Southern court, a
Negro will seldom be treated seriously, and his testimony
against a white man will be ignored, if he is permitted to
express it at all. When sentenced he is usually given a
heavier punishment and probation or suspended sentence
is seldom allowed him....</p>
</div>

<p>Myrdal goes on to remark that when white lawyers,
installment collectors, insurance agents, plantation owners,
and others cheat the Negroes of the South, they are “never”
regarded as criminals. But stealing by Negroes from whites
is almost always punished as a crime.</p>

<p>These things occur in the North, Myrdal asserts, although
in a much smaller degree. In the North, the trouble is that
the Negro has brought certain cultural practices with him
from the South. Also, the Negro is poor. He cannot bribe
policemen to let him off; he has no influential connections;
he does not know the important people who can help him
out of trouble.</p>

<p>In brief, Myrdal says, the statistics “do not provide a
fair index of Negro crime.” And for a typical example of
the fallacies that permeate the statistics, “the Negro rape
rate, like other Negro crime rates, is fallaciously high: white
women may try to extricate themselves from the consequences
of sexual delinquency by blaming or framing Negro
men; a white woman who has a Negro lover can get rid of
him or avoid social ostracism following detection by accusing
him of rape; neurotic white women may hysterically
interpret an innocent action as an ‘attack’ by a Negro.”</p>

<p>In addition to the statistical distortions that result (1)
from basic discrimination against Negroes and (2) from the
Negro’s poverty and ignorance of the law, Myrdal finds a
third “group of causes of Negro crime.” This, he says, is
“connected with the slavery tradition and the caste situation.”
Negroes in the South traditionally have been permitted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
pilfer small items from their employers; the practice has
imbued them with a general disrespect for property rights.
And their feeling that there is nothing wrong with petty
stealing “is strengthened by the fact that Negroes know
that their white employers are exploiting them.”</p>

<p>Beyond all this, Myrdal says, as a cause of “Negro crime,”
is the Negro’s hatred of whites. The revenge motive figures
in Negro muggings and headings: “Because the white man
regards him as apart from society, it is natural for a Negro
to regard himself as apart. He does not participate in making
the laws in the South, and he has little chance to enforce
them. To the average lower class Negro, at least in
the South, the police, the courts, and even the law are arbitrary
and hostile to Negroes, and thus are to be avoided or
fought against. The ever-present hostility to the law and
law-enforcement agencies on the part of all Southern Negroes
and many Northern Negroes does not often manifest itself
in an outbreak against them because the risks are too great.
But occasionally this hostility does express itself, and then
there is crime.”</p>

<p>Myrdal concludes by asserting: “We know that Negroes
are not biologically more criminal than whites. We do not
know definitely that Negroes are culturally more criminal,
although we do know that they come up against law-enforcement
agencies more often. We suspect that the ‘true’ crime
rate&mdash;when extraneous influences are held constant&mdash;is
higher among Negroes. This is true at least for such crimes
as involve personal violence, petty robbery, and sexual delinquency&mdash;because
of the caste system and the slavery
tradition....”</p>

<p>Myrdal wrote in 1944. The statistics he struggled so wildly
to discredit have not changed significantly in the past eighteen
years. In this period, the Negro’s position in American society
has improved phenomenally; his political power has significantly
increased in most Southern cities and has become
decisive in many Northern wards and congressional districts.
In both North and South, Negroes sit on juries, appear as
counsel, serve as police officers. Myrdal’s specious and
shabby rationalizations based upon “discrimination” simply
will not hold up in any national view. And of some of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
fatuous explanations (that many white criminals blacken
their faces to put blame on innocent Negroes, that white
women are responsible for a fallaciously high Negro rape
rate because they frame Negro men, that <em>all</em> Southern
Negroes are seized of an <em>ever-present</em> hostility to law and
law enforcement) the less said, the better. Yet Myrdal is
so widely touted as the ablest authority on the American
Negro that the Supreme Court of the United States, in the
<em>Brown</em> case, suggested that his work be “seen generally”
as a support for the court’s reasoning!</p>

<p>Well, the palpable truth is that many white men also are
poor; they too know frustrations, feel resentments, fear the
real world they live in. But studies of arrests by place of
residence, correlated against census data on housing, suggest
no levels of criminality in poor and underprivileged
white neighborhoods that compare with criminality in generally
comparable Negro neighborhoods. Crime always may
be measured by an index of poverty, and it is true that
poverty exists far more widely among Negroes than among
whites; but if poverty were the whole explanation, or even
a key explanation, surely the remarkable increases in Negro
per capita income over the past fifty years should be reflected
in some corresponding decrease in rates of crime
among the Negro people. <em>No such correspondence exists.</em>
The Negroes of America are better off materially, culturally,
and politically than any Negroid people in the world, and
their lot improves at an incredible speed. Yet there are the
facts on trends in illegitimacy; and there are the facts on
trends in crime. And the insistent <em>why?</em> will not go away.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Weyl, who started his studies with an environmentalist’s
view, concludes his chapter on Negro criminality
with a comment that the character patterns disclosed by the
facts are “presumably genetic in origin.” Dr. W. C. George,
head of the Department of Anatomy at the University of
North Carolina, also tends to find an explanation in racial
factors: “Whatever other virtues Negroes may have, and
they have many, all of the evidence that I know about&mdash;and
there is a lot of it&mdash;indicates that the Caucasian race is
superior to the Negro race in the creation and maintenance
of what we call civilization.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>A great many white Southerners accept this thesis implicitly
and unquestioningly; they infer the innate “inferiority”
of the typical Negro, in terms of Western cultural
values, simply on the basis of their lifelong observation of
the Negro people about them. No other explanation appeals
to their common sense, or to their native prejudice, or to
both. This is something they <em>know</em>, and they profess to
know it not in anthropological terms (the weight of brains,
the pigmentation of skins, the length of appendages, the
formation of skull and jaw), but in terms of ordinary human
observation.</p>

<p>I incline toward this view myself, but I certainly would
not assert, as Myrdal asserts the contrary, that I “know”
it to be true. I would be agreeable to accepting the temperate
and tentative conclusion voiced by Professor G. M. Morant,
of England, in a most unlikely place&mdash;an essay in UNESCO’s
<cite>Race and Prejudice</cite> (Columbia, 1961). The volume as a
whole is almost worthless to the objective student; most of
the essays are no more than special pleading by propagandists
against racial prejudice. But Morant examines the evidence
of intelligence tests and other data with a scientist’s objectivity,
and he concludes by saying this:</p>

<p>“There seems to be no reason why the general rule regarding
variation within and between groups should not
apply to mental as well as to physical characters. If variable
characters of the former kind showed identical distributions
for all racial populations, that would be a situation unparalleled,
as far as is known, as regards any physical
character in man or in any other animal. It seems to be
impossible to evade the conclusion that some racial differences
in mental characters must be expected. Existing evidence
may not be extensive and cogent enough to reveal
them, but it must be inferred that some exist....”</p>

<p>Morant makes the point, in analyzing intelligence-test
scores, that obviously white and Negro scores overlap. Consistently,
the most superior Negroes will score higher as a
group than the most inferior whites as a group. Moreover,
the difference between the average scores of two racial populations
may be quite small compared with the range of
scores in either group. But even when this is so, says Morant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
“there may be a marked difference between the relative
frequencies in the population of individuals having extreme
values of the measurement.” And this distinction may be
important in the case of some mental characteristics: “There
may be almost equal proportions of stupid, mediocre, and
able people in two populations; even so, exceptional ability
may be found with a frequency of 1 in 1,000 in one group,
and of 1 in 10,000 in the other. Having a larger proportion
of exceptionally able members may be a factor which tells
decisively in favor of a population in the course of centuries
or millenniums.”</p>

<p>The Liberal social anthropologists, to be sure, have denounced
this reasonable hypothesis out of hand; and by
effectively dominating the professional field, they have managed
to elevate their own opinions to the status of truth,
to promote speculation to the level of fact, and to convert
surmise deftly into incontrovertible proof. I believe they have
overdone it. They have lost their own case by their own
disgraceful intemperance and intolerance of dissent; they
protest too much; they cover up; they propagandize; they
set out not to seek truth, but “to combat racial prejudice.”</p>

<p>At the same time, I would insert a comment that some
of the more intemperate protagonists on the segregationist
Right have fallen into the same errors of positivism and
unqualified statement. They have tended to think too much
in blanket terms&mdash;in literal blacks and whites&mdash;and they
have regularly overestimated the factors of heredity and
underestimated the factors of environment. Their position
would be improved if they simply acknowledged that the
question of the Negro’s innate inferiority has not been proved
and hence is still open.</p>

<p>In terms of the problem immediately at hand, the question
of whether the Negro’s shortcomings are “innate” seems
to me largely irrelevant anyhow. The issue is not likely to
be proved to the satisfaction of either side any time soon;
it may not be susceptible of proof at all. Whether these
characteristics are inherited or acquired, they <em>are</em>. And communities
North and South (but especially in the South, and
more especially still, in the rural South) must cope with
conditions as they find them. The ruins of Zimbadwe are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
a long way from Prince Edward County, Virginia, and the
finest analysis of electroencephalic findings among the Zulus
is of small importance in teaching a class of Alabama sixth-graders.
The arguments of anthropology are of interest to
the South, and I would not wish to leave any impression
that would minimize their importance; the fear of ultimate
racial interbreeding, encouraged by prospective generations
of desegregated and integrated school systems, is a very real
fear in the South and not an imagined one. If these Negro
characteristics are innate, the white Southerner sees nothing
but disaster to his race in risking an accelerated intermingling
of blood lines. And even if these Negro characteristics are
not innate, the white Southerner wants no intimate association
with them anyhow. And he is determined not to let
his children be guinea pigs for any man’s social experiment.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The second of the South’s principal arguments, related to
anthropological considerations but of more immediate application,
may be termed the argument of practicality: Even if it
be true, as the liberal social anthropologists insist, that there is
no innate cultural or intellectual inferiority in the Negro race
as such, the plain fact is that here and now, there are immense
differences in the educational achievements and apparent aptitudes
of the two races; and these differences, especially in
small rural communities, make true integration of public
schools an impossibility. Beyond this, the educational needs of
white and Negro children in the South, in terms of the lives
they will lead and the employment they predictably will find,
are quite different; and these differences, especially in the
small counties, create formidable problems of curriculum.
Finally, the temper, and prejudices, and feelings of the white
taxpayers, who overwhelmingly bear the bulk of public school
costs, simply cannot be discounted altogether; political realities
have to be considered, and grave thought must be given, as a
practical matter, to the social upheaval that inevitably would
accompany massive desegregation of public schools in those
areas of the South where Negro populations are greatest and
traditions of racial separation are most deeply ingrained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p>As Otto Klineberg points out in <cite>Characteristics of the
American Negro</cite>, efforts to test the intelligence or the educational
aptitude of Negro children go back a long way. In 1897,
G. R. Stetson gave memory tests to fourth- and fifth-graders in
the District of Columbia; the Negro pupils, who averaged a
year and a half older than the whites, proved superior in memorizing
three out of four stanzas of poetry. Truly is it said
that the first shall be last and the last shall be first, for Stetson’s
findings of 1897 represent one of the very few such inquiries
in which Negroes have scored higher than whites. Since then,
an exhaustive series of tests almost invariably have produced
data pointing just the other way.</p>

<p>In 1913, A. C. Strong studied white and Negro school
children of Columbia, S. C., and found the colored children
mentally younger. The following year, B. A. Phillips reported
on an analysis of twenty-nine white and twenty-nine Negro
children who had been equated in terms of home environment,
and found such a difference in mentality between the two
groups that he wondered if they should be instructed under
the same curriculum. In 1916, G. O. Ferguson tested white
and Negro pupils of Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Newport
News, Va., and found the superiority of the white group indubitable.
In this same study he attempted further to classify
the Negro subjects according to skin color (pure Negro, three-fourths
Negro, mulatto, and quadroon), and found a plain
correlation between higher scores and lighter skins.</p>

<p>Intelligence testing by racial groups was launched on a
large scale with World War I. As an aid to military authorities,
three separate tests were devised. The first, known as Army
A, never was very widely used; it contained some four hundred
items and featured two tests, of immediate memory and
cancellation, which proved to be impracticable. Analyses of
findings were made, however, by Ferguson and by Robert M.
Yerkes, of 10,276 Negro soldiers and 38,628 white soldiers
tested on Army A at Camp Lee and Camp Dix. The median
score among Negro recruits ranged from 14.8 at Lee to 53
at Dix, the white recruits from 116 at Lee to 171 at Dix.</p>

<p>In an effort to devise a more useful test, a committee of
five psychologists, led by Yerkes, was appointed by the American
Psychological Association in April 1917. They put together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
tests that came to be known as Army Alpha and Army
Beta. The tests, which brought together the most advanced
psychological knowledge of their day, still are widely respected
by psychologists forty-five years later. Henry E. Garrett,
professor emeritus of psychology at Columbia University,
has said of them that “owing to the size of the groups and
the lack of special selection, the army test data yield probably
the fairest and most unbiased comparison of Negro and white
intelligence which we possess.”</p>

<p>The Alpha test was divided into eight sections, testing the
examinee’s ability in following directions, arithmetic problems,
practical judgment, synonyms and antonyms, disarranged sentences,
completion of number series, analogies, and general
information. The psychologists’ committee realized, however,
that because of its heavy reliance upon literacy and cultural
factors, the Alpha test would tell Army examiners little about
the intelligence and capacity of recruits whose schooling was
limited and whose cultural background was poor. Hence the
Beta test was devised, as a nonlanguage test on which all
illiterates could compete equally.</p>

<p>The average score of the white soldier on the Alpha test
was 59, that of the Northern Negro 39, and that of the
Southern Negro 12. The better educational equipment of the
whites presumably might account for some of this astonishing
difference, without considering any questions of innate ability
at all. But this superior equipment did not figure on the Beta
test. And on Beta, the whites averaged 43, the Northern Negro
33, and the Southern Negro 20. Analyzing these Beta findings
in one study of men tested at Camp Grant, M. R. Trabue
concluded that the average Northern Negro recruit had an
ability to learn new things about equivalent to that of the
average eleven-year-old white boy, and the average Southern
Negro recruit a mental capacity at the nine-year-old level.</p>

<p>Notably, the figures on Negro “overlapping” were not significantly
different for the two tests. It was found that only 27
per cent of the Negroes exceeded the white average score on
Alpha. On Beta, the figure was 29 per cent. As Dr. McGurk
has pointed out, if the Negroes’ comparatively poor scores
were entirely a consequence of social and economic differences,
a lessening of these differences should have produced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in the Beta test, a corresponding increase in the Negro overlap.
Put another way: “An improvement in cultural opportunities
should result in an improvement in the capacity for
education. If cultural opportunities are not important in determining
capacity for education, improving the cultural opportunities
will have no effect on capacity for education.”
And Dr. McGurk, it should be remembered, is a Villanova
social scientist who has devoted a lifetime to research in this
field.</p>

<p>The massive statistics of the World War I tests have served
as grist for the mills of a hundred psychologists and social
anthropologists. Those of the equalitarian school have done
some curious things with the figures, in a strained effort to
prove that significant differences in racial scores are related
solely to environment and not at all to heredity. The student
who inquires into the literature scarcely can pick up an equalitarian
book that does not offer the following table:</p>

<p class="p1">Klineberg, who used this table in his 1944 work, says the
comparison shows that Northern Negroes “are superior to
the white groups from a number of Southern States.”</p>

<p>Taken at face value, that is certainly one conclusion that
might be drawn, at least as to four Southern States, but the
figures merit a closer look. What Klineberg did, as Garrett
has shown, was to take the four Southern States where the
white medians were <em>lowest</em> and compare them with the four
Northern States where the Negro medians were <em>highest</em>.
Beyond demonstrating that Negroes in some Northern States
scored higher than whites in some Southern States, this widely
reproduced table tells us little.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Moreover, Klineberg&mdash;and Montagu, and Benedict, and
others who are so fond of this data&mdash;do not present the
figures from the four Northern States that might truly have
significance in terms of local problems of public education.
Garrett, whose computations of medians differ slightly from
Klineberg’s, puts the data together in this fashion:</p>

<p class="p1">Garrett then makes the self-evident point that Negroes
in these four States scored as far below white soldiers <em>from
the same States</em> as they scored below whites in the country
as a whole. The student who wants to dig more deeply into
these World War I findings will find them fully reported in
professional literature. Audrey Shuey’s <cite>The Testing of Negro
Intelligence</cite> summarizes the data and provides an extensive
bibliography of work done on the figures.</p>

<p>It is curious that so much labor has been spent on the
World War I figures, and relatively so little on the more up-to-date
data from World War II and Korea. Yet from one
point of view this is not so curious either: In the thirty-six
years between 1917 and 1943, the American Negro experienced
prodigious gains in educational, cultural, economic,
and social opportunities. Surely, it might be thought, these
gains would have been reflected in some significant improvement
in his military test scores. No such improvement can
be detected. Nathaniel Weyl has summed up the facts:</p>

<p>“A comparison of Army General Classification Test
(AGCT) scores of white and Negro enlisted men in military
service in March, 1945, shows that 6.3 per cent of the
whites, but only 1.0 per cent of the Negroes, were in Group
I (very superior) and that 39.7 per cent of the whites, but
only 7.4 per cent of the Negroes, were in the first two (better
than average) categories. On the other hand, only 26.9<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
per cent of the whites, as contrasted with 77.7 per cent of
the Negroes (more than three-fourths of them), were in the
two bottom (inferior and very inferior) groups.”</p>

<p>In World War I, Weyl continues, the Negro overlap on
the combined tests was 13.5 per cent&mdash;that is, 13½ Negroes
in 100 scored as well as the average white man. By the
time of World War II, the overlap had dropped to 12 per
cent, and if the scores of mental rejects are included for
both races, to only 10 per cent. Still more embarrassing to
the equalitarians, their precious comparisons of World War I
between Northern Negroes and Southern whites tend to dissolve
in the findings of World War II. Weyl summarizes a
comparison between Negroes examined in the First Command
Area (New England), where Negroes had the highest
median, with white recruits examined in the Fourth Command
Area (Southern), where white medians were lowest.
Some 34 per cent of the Southern whites made scores of
superior or very superior; only 9 per cent of the Northern
Negroes were in these brackets.</p>

<p>Finally, on the matter of AGCT scores, mention may be
made of an unpublished master’s thesis by B. E. Fulk of
the University of Illinois; the paper is cited by Shuey in her
encompassing survey of the field. Fulk obtained data on
2174 white and 2010 Negro enlisted men examined by the
Army Air Force Service Command. He then correlated their
AGCT scores in terms of the years of education they had
experienced. It may well be true that the Negroes here tested
had attended poorer schools than the whites; but to persons
interested in understanding some of the real and practical
problems of school desegregation, Fulk’s tabulations will be
rewarding (see page 78).</p>

<p>If the formidable gaps shown by those figures do not persuade
the South’s critics of the difficult problems implicit in
welding together two country high schools, one white, the
other Negro, perhaps no evidence would persuade them. Yet
abundant other evidence is widely available.</p>

<p class="p1">Dr. Shuey has put the facts together in a book that cannot
be overlooked by serious students of the desegregation problem.
She is head of the Department of Psychology at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College in Virginia. Her massive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
labors have had a stunning impact upon the more idealistic
advocates of immediate integration. Here in cold statistical
tables, unwarmed by subjective opinion, she has summarized
more than forty years of investigation into Negro intelligence.
These are not her findings; they are the findings of
scholars who have done original or independent research. No
matter how these findings may be explained away (and the
NAACP has retained a committee of psychologists now
seeking desperately to explain them away), the figures speak
tellingly of the problems that educators must face in mixing
the two races massively in the same classrooms.</p>

<p>The literature discloses that at the preschool level, there is
a marked but not unmanageable difference between white
and Negro aptitudes. A typical Stanford-Binet test of five-year-olds,
for example, may turn up a median of 112 for
white children, 95.8 for Negro children. The gap is dismayingly
wide, but it can be coped with.</p>

<p>Thereafter, as the children move into upper grades, the
tendency is for the gap to grow steadily greater. Dr. Shuey
made an analysis of 101 tests given to Negro elementary-school
children from one end of the country to the other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Some of these tests were given by Negro psychologists, in
an effort to improve the rapport between examiner and subject.
In other investigations, careful efforts were made to
equate the home backgrounds of white and Negro subjects.
All told, the 101 investigations cover findings on 51,000
colored children, and provide 310 comparisons for relative
standing of colored and white. “In 297 of the comparisons,”
Dr. Shuey notes, “the colored children scored the lower;
in 144 they were lower than the white norms.”</p>

<p>Dr. McGurk’s analysis of the professional literature in this
field closely parallels Dr. Shuey’s report. Between 1935 and
1950, he has stated, sixty-three articles appeared in professional
journals of psychology dealing with Negro-white test-score
differences. <em>In all sixty-three of them</em>, the average test
score of the Negro subjects was found to be lower than the
average test score of the white subjects with whom they were
compared. Six of these investigations are regarded by McGurk
as especially significant:</p>

<p>1. A study of a group of Canadian Negroes and whites
in 1939 by H. A. Tanser. The Negro children tested were
the descendants of slaves who had escaped from the South
prior to and during the Civil War. Their social and economic
opportunities had been generally equal to those of whites in
the area. Yet the findings of three standard psychological
tests administered to children in grades 1-8 found the Negro
averages far below the white averages at every age and every
grade. For the total groups, only 13 to 20 per cent of the
Negroes overlapped the white average, and in no case did
the overlap exceed 20 per cent.</p>

<p>2. A study of white and Negro children in a poor section
of rural Virginia, done by M. Bruce in 1940. In order to
eliminate the factor of social and economic differences, the
author first administered a test of socio-economic status, and
then paired off her subjects so that each member of a pair,
one Negro child and one white child, had the same socio-economic
score. Negro overlapping on three separate tests
ranged between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.</p>

<p>3. A study by Dr. Shuey of white and Negro college
students in New York, in 1942. Again, the Negro and white
students were first given socio-economic tests in order to pair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
them off. The Negro overlap amounted to 18 per cent. Of
this investigation, Dr. McGurk says: “Considering that this
was a highly selected group of college students, such low
overlapping is surprising. It does not lend credence to the
belief that socio-economic factors are responsible for the
Negro-white differences in psychological test performance.”</p>

<p>4. A study of white and Negro kindergarten children in
Minneapolis, 1944, done by F. Brown. The test scores found
a 31 per cent overlapping. (At very early ages, overlap always
is greater because tests deal more with performance and with
sensory-motor responses, and less with verbal skills).</p>

<p>5. A study by T. F. Rhoads and associates of white and
Negro children at the age of three. This was a very detailed
study, in which each of the subjects was clinically examined
from birth until the time he was administered a psychological
test. Socio-economic factors were reported to be generally
equal for the entire group of subjects. The overlapping
amounted to 30 per cent.</p>

<p>6. A study by McGurk himself of Negro and white high
school seniors in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Again,
Negroes and whites were matched for social and economic
status by pairing a white subject with each Negro subject
so that both members of a pair were identical or equivalent
for fourteen different socio-economic factors. These students
then took a test composed half of “cultural questions,”
and half of “non-cultural questions.” McGurk’s finding: “In
spite of the equivalence of socio-economic factors, 29 per
cent of the Negro subjects overlapped the average total score
of the white subjects. This is almost identical with the overlapping
reported in the Alpha and Beta tests of World War
I. There is hardly any question about the socio-economic
superiority of this 1951 group of Negroes when compared
with the Negroes of World War I. Yet, relative to white
subjects, the intervening improvements in social and economic
opportunities of the Negroes had not improved their
psychological test performance at all.”</p>

<p>In 1953, Dr. McGurk published an additional study in
the <cite>Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology</cite>, “On White
and Negro Test Performance and Socio-Economic Factors.”
Here he reclassified the subjects of his 1951 study, in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to compare the 25 per cent of each race who might be regarded
as a “high group” and as a “low group” in terms of
socio-economic factors. Rearrangement of the data made
no difference. It became apparent that socio-economic factors
had not made the two groups equally proficient in psychological
tests. “The average score of the high Negro group
was very much lower than the average score of the whites
of equivalent socio-economic status. In terms of Negro overlap,
only 18 per cent of these Negro children of excellent
socio-economic background obtained test scores that equalled
or exceeded the average white score.”</p>

<p>Assuming that the liberal social anthropologists are right
in what they say, that social and economic forces are of
paramount importance, McGurk comments, “There should
have been no differences between Negroes and whites in any
of these comparisons. As it actually turned out, the difference
between Negroes and whites is much greater when
both groups are of high socio-economic status than when
the racial groups are of deprived socio-economic status.”</p>

<p>Further analysis of McGurk’s 1951 study in terms of the
“cultural questions” and the “noncultural” questions totally
disproved the notion that cultural questions on these intelligence
tests unduly hold back the Negro in his performance.
Taking the cultural questions alone, it was found that
24 per cent of the high Negro group overlapped the average
scores of the high white group. On the noncultural questions,
where it might have been expected that the Negroes would
do better, they did worse: Barely one out of five of the high
Negro group overlapped the high white group. Comparing
the two low groups, McGurk found that the low Negro
group actually had an insignificantly higher average score
than the low white group on the cultural questions, with an
overlap of about 55 per cent. On the noncultural questions,
the average of the low white group was significantly greater
than that of the low Negro group. There was an overlap of
about 29 per cent.</p>

<p>McGurk has summed up his conclusions in this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Regardless of our emotional attachment to the school
desegregation problem, certain facts must be faced. First,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
as far as psychological test performance is a measure of
capacity for education, Negroes as a group do not possess
as much of it as whites as a group. This has been demonstrated
over and over.</p>

<p>Next, we must realize that, since 1918, the vast improvements
in the social and economic status of the Negro have
not changed his relationship to the whites regarding capacity
for education. This is not to say that this relationship
cannot be changed; it says merely that it has not been
changed....</p>

<p>Thirdly, as far as our knowledge of the problem goes,
the improvements in the social and economic opportunities
have only increased the differences between Negroes and
whites. This is because such improvements have been given
to both racial groups&mdash;not only to the Negro&mdash;and the
whites have profited the more from them. This serves to
emphasize the former statement that a fruitful approach
to racial equality cannot follow the lines of social and
economic manipulation. There is something more important,
more basic, to the race problem than differences in
external opportunity.</p>

<p>Dr. McGurk’s conclusions, it should be said in fairness
(even in this partisan brief), have been widely denounced
by his equalitarian colleagues. Following publication of his
1956 statement in <cite>U. S. News &amp; World Report</cite>, eighteen
social scientists united in a rebuttal assertion that “given
similar degrees of cultural opportunity to realize their potentialities,
the average achievement of the members of each
ethnic group is about the same.” And in the Spring 1958,
issue of <cite>Harvard Educational Review</cite>, William M. McCord,
an assistant professor of sociology at Stanford University,
and Nicholas J. Demerath, III, of Harvard, a senior student,
returned to the attack on McGurk.</p>

<p>In my own view, the rejoinders of McCord and Demerath
are remarkably feeble. The investigations they cite, in
an effort to refute McGurk’s conclusions, provide no refutation
at all. Their own study of “predelinquent” and normal
boys in Cambridge-Somerville, Mass., is so affected by subjective
evaluations that it contributes little to an objective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
appraisal of conditions that confront school administrators
elsewhere. (They attempted to establish a correlation between
the boys’ intelligence and their social class, parental education,
“home atmosphere,” and “personality of the boys’
fathers”; other factors dealt with the subjects’ homes&mdash;cohesive,
quarrelsome, quarrelsome-neglecting, or broken&mdash;and
whether the boys’ fathers were loving, passive, cruel, neglecting,
or absent.) In any event, most of their elaborately tabulated
findings tend merely to support McGurk’s own conclusion
that at the lowest social levels, white and Negro test
scores are not significantly different.</p>

<p>The evidence put together by Shuey and McGurk is solid,
dispassionate, unbiased, overwhelming; it cannot be disregarded&mdash;not,
that is, if one wishes to gain any real understanding
of the problems that confront local school boards
over much of the South. To pull the general figures down to
a single, specific case study, consider the findings of some
tests administered in Dallas in 1954-55. There more than
1600 Negro pupils and almost 5700 white pupils were tested
in the first grade on their general readiness for learning&mdash;on
their ability to pay attention, follow directions, handle
crayons and pencils, understand and use language, and so
on. These were the findings:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<p>For another specific example, consider the findings in Virginia
among pupils of an older age group. Over a period of
five successive years, between 1949-50 and 1953-54, the
State Department of Education administered the Iowa Silent
Reading Test to all eighth-graders in the Virginia public
school system. This is a standardized achievement test in
reading, employed by school systems throughout the country
to discover certain facts of immediate, practical importance
to classroom teachers: How well do the children
read? How well do they understand? The tests in Virginia
were given in May of each year, when all of the children
had a grade placement of 8.8 (eighth year, eighth month).
Scores on the Iowa test are calibrated to match the grade
placement, so that a pupil who scores a reading-grade equivalent
of 8.7 would be one month retarded in achievement,
and a pupil who scores a reading-grade equivalent of 8.9
would be one month advanced in achievement.</p>

<p>This is what the Virginia tests found in May 1954, the
month of the <em>Brown</em> decision (findings were not significantly
different in the four preceding years): The median white
child in the county schools was about half a year behind the
achievement level he should have reached; he was reading
at a level of 8.3 (eighth grade, third month). But the median
Negro child in the county schools was reading at a level of
6.2 (sixth grade, second month). The top one-fourth of the
white children (75th percentile) were reading at a level of
the tenth grade, third month, or better; but the top one-fourth
of the Negro children were not even at the 8.8 level&mdash;the
75th percentile among the Negro pupils was found at
7.5.</p>

<p>Scores on the Virginia tests were higher in the city schools,
but among the Negro pupils, not much higher. In the cities,
the median white eighth-grader was found to be reading
at a level of the ninth grade, second month; the median
Negro eighth-grader scored 6.5. In less statistical language,
this means simply that in terms of reading skills, which are
the foundation of all other academic skills, Virginia’s white
eighth-graders as a group were found in 1954 to be from
two years to nearly three full years ahead of the Negro
eighth-graders as a group. Subsequent tests, administered on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
a more limited scale since 1954, have shown no material
change.</p>

<p>Now, how is one to organize a viable public school&mdash;a
completely desegregated school&mdash;under such conditions as
these? If one is the superintendent of schools in the District
of Columbia, one can cope with what Dr. Carl F. Hansen
has described as “the enormous educational problem of
upgrading large numbers of educationally handicapped children”
by a variety of devices: Squads of psychiatrists, platoons
of remedial-reading instructors, a “four-track” system,
and the like. And if one spends enough money, and has
enough pupils and buildings to permit some shuffling around
among schools, and pays salaries high enough to keep some
of the most competent teachers in the country, one can
accomplish a good deal. But how many rural counties in
the South, where the <em>total</em> school population may number
only 2000 or 2500, can possibly apply the drastic remedies
found necessary in Washington?</p>

<p>Consider the schools of Washington, D. C. The capital is
the showcase of the nation in terms of desegregation. If
genuinely “mixed” schools are to work anywhere, they should
work best in the District of Columbia, where every factor
combines to produce the most favorable opportunity: The
political climate of a Federal administration anxious to
achieve integration, the immense resources of a lavish school
budget, the cultural amenities freely available to all children
as an adjunct to learning, the absence of racial discrimination
in employment, the untypically high incomes and job
status of many Negro families. It is entirely reasonable to
assume that pupils in the Washington schools, as a group,
should not be merely average, or slightly above average;
they should in fact lead the entire country. Moreover, it seems
a fair assumption that the exodus of white families from the
District has tended to leave behind those white children who
in general are less able mentally and more nearly on the
Negro’s cultural level. If Negro pupils are to show up well
anywhere, they should show up well here. The facts indicate
nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>The District of Columbia desegregated its schools in
September 1954, following the Supreme Court’s opinion the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
preceding May. In October 1955, after a year of experience
with desegregation, the Stanford Advanced Reading and
Arithmetic Tests were given to some 4600 eighth-grade
pupils in the Washington public schools&mdash;1600 white pupils
and 3000 Negro pupils. The findings in Washington almost
exactly paralleled the findings in Virginia: Two-thirds of the
Negro children were found to be reading at the sixth-grade
level <em>or below</em> (21 per cent of the Negro eighth-graders,
indeed, were reading at the fifth-grade level, and 22 per
cent were reading at the fourth-grade level). Only 12 per
cent of the white eighth-graders were at the sixth-grade
level or below, and 54 per cent of the white pupils were at
the tenth-grade level or above.</p>

<p>Shocked officials of the District of Columbia plunged
headlong into remedial programs. Their herculean labors
have been reported widely and sympathetically. At once, the
four-track system was devised, and pupils systematically
were assigned to (1) an honors program, (2) a general college-preparatory
program, (3) a program for pupils not
planning to go to college, and (4) a remedial basic curriculum
for slow-learning pupils. One effect was to achieve
a very substantial resegregation, for the great bulk of those
on tracks 1 and 2 turned out to be white pupils, and the great
bulk of those on tracks 3 and 4 turned out to be Negro
pupils. The resegregation process was helped along materially
by Washington’s younger white families, who fled
the District by the thousands. In 1950, Washington’s schools
were almost evenly balanced, 50-50, in white and colored
enrollment; ten years later, white pupils constituted 20 per
cent, Negro pupils 80 per cent, of the enrollment. Remedial
classes for slow learners, in which teaching specialists work
with groups averaging no more than eighteen per class, have
been swiftly stepped up; there were seventy-four such classes
in 1954; the number grew to 225 in the 1959-60 session.
The reading-clinic staff increased from twelve to thirty-two
in that period of time, and a special Division of Pupil Appraisal
more than doubled with the addition of a dozen
school psychologists, clinical psychologists, and psychiatric
social workers. New batteries of achievement tests were administered
every year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>At the close of the school year in 1959, five full years
after racial discrimination had been obliterated from the
Washington schools, Dr. Hansen released some figures on
how things were going. To the integrationist Washington
<cite>Post</cite>, reporting happily on the data, things were going marvelously
well: “District pupils’ performance on standardized
tests this year topped last year’s scores in 15 of the 27 subjects
tested, School Superintendent Carl F. Hansen reported
yesterday.” The cheery tone of the <cite>Post’s</cite> story was somewhat
belied by the glum figures themselves. Washington’s
sixth-graders had managed to achieve median scores in spelling,
language, and arithmetical computation exactly matching&mdash;no
more&mdash;the national norms for these three sixth-grade
tests. Medians on the other twenty-four tests were
below national norms, in some instances by as much as a
full year. Ninth-graders who should have scored a median of
9.4 (ninth year, fourth month) in computation and paragraph
meaning scored 8.3 and 8.4 respectively. Dr. Hansen’s
report on tests at the third-grade and fifth-grade levels
has special interest:</p>

<p class="p1">It should not escape notice that the Washington children
whose median scores are shown in the foregoing table never
had known a day of legally segregated schooling. The Negro
pupils here tested never had suffered the school discrimination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
likely to affect their hearts and minds in a fashion never
to be undone. These pupils, on the contrary, had had the
benefit of all the special attention that could be given them
by a school administration frantically eager to demonstrate
the glories of integration. No resource of guidance and special
teaching, no visual aid or teaching technique had been
denied them. Yet there are the scores: Not a single test in
Washington’s third and fifth grades produced a median equal
to the national norm. The fifth-graders, backsliding, did not
even equal fifth-grade scores the preceding year.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to dwell further upon the findings
of intelligence and achievement tests beyond commenting
briefly upon some of the flimsy efforts the equalitarians make
to discredit them. One objection is that the Negro child has
no “motivation” to do well on them; but at the younger
age levels especially, this is pure conjecture. It also is complained
that frequently the tests are administered to Negro
children by white examiners, and that an essential rapport
thereby is denied them; but this was not true of the tests in
Washington, and it has not been true of many other investigations.
The most frequent objection is that tests tend to
compare white and colored children of unequal social and
economic background; but abundant evidence is available
of investigations in which subjects have been “paired” by
every imaginable criterion, and almost without exception
these tests show the same lamentable contrasts in white and
Negro scores.</p>

<p>Otto Klineberg has attempted to dismiss all the findings:
“Until and unless the <em>same</em> education is given to both races,
comparisons will be unfair.” But it manifestly is impossible
to give the <em>same</em> education to any two groups. All that one
can do is to provide the same textbooks, the same teaching
aids, teachers with the same degree of education, and physical
facilities generally comparable&mdash;but even then, identity
of total educational opportunity could not possibly be
achieved. The various tests now being administered in school
systems across the country are as fair and objective as competent
psychologists and educators can make them; and the
bleak, undeniable fact, confirmed repeatedly in school districts
both North and South, is that colored children regularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
score at lower levels than the white children of their
communities. Thoughtful students of the difficult problem
before the South will comprehend what the evidence means
in terms of the real and practical obstacles to welding together
white and Negro schools in rural areas below the
Potomac.</p>

<p>Other very real difficulties merit reflection also. The disputations
of social scientists cannot be considered in a vacuum,
nor the findings of achievement tests treated as so
many punched cards for an IBM machine. These are <em>children</em>
we are concerned with, white and Negro alike, and the fact
is (I do not argue the goodness or badness of the fact; I
merely cite its existence) that white and Negro children in
the South have many quite different educational requirements.
The essentially dual and separate society of the South
cannot be dissolved overnight by court decree. For years to
come in the South, the practice of law and medicine, the
handling of banking and finance, the sale of stocks and
bonds, the management of large retail and wholesale enterprises,
and the administration of commerce and government
will continue to be overwhelmingly restricted to white persons.
This is not to say that many able Negroes are not
engaged in these fields now; they are, and their number is
increasing, but they are conspicuous exceptions. In rural
areas especially, where professional and business opportunities
naturally are severely limited, the realities of adult opportunity
are even more striking.</p>

<p>All this has to be considered practically in terms of curriculum
planning, guidance, teaching emphasis, and the like.
Nothing very significant is accomplished, really, in offering
physics or calculus to rural Negro boys who intend to drop
out at the ninth-grade level and go to work farming or cutting
pulpwood. Negro girls who realistically expect to find
employment in a tobacco stemmery, a laundry, a bakery,
or in domestic service have educational requirements materially
different from those of their white counterparts. The
impatient theoretician, unwilling even to attempt to understand
a social order he so thoroughly disapproves, doubtless
will be repelled by this line of reasoning. But the reasoning
has a way of making sense in rural county seats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p>A point is made of the exceptional Negro students. What
of them? Why should a brilliant and ambitious colored
youngster be held back by the relative ineptitude of his
typical colored classmates? My answer is that he should not
be held back, and I believe that in the course of time, this
will be the answer of the South as a whole. When colored
students appear who demonstrate the intellectual ability to
compete at top levels with their white counterparts, I am
wholly agreeable to any plan that would bring them, by
transfer, to the finest high schools for miles around. Virginia
has just such a program slowly formulating in its plan of
“Freedom of Choice.” But I would suggest that one consequence
of such transfers of exceptional children, in the
foreseeable future, would be to deny the slower Negro
pupils the example and stimulation of superior students of
their own race. The tendency would be further to reduce the
achievement levels of the colored schools as such. But I
would leave such decisions to the pupils and their parents
themselves.</p>

<p>I have attempted to set forth two practical objections to
school desegregation in the South, and especially in the
rural South&mdash;first, the demonstrably lower levels of aptitude
and achievement on the Negro’s part, and second, the demonstrably
different opportunities and occupations for which
most colored pupils realistically must prepare themselves.
A third difficulty involves the teaching staffs. The massive
desegregation of Southern schools predictably would have
a catastrophic effect upon the thousands of Negro men and
women who now enjoy, within their race, relatively high
status and relatively good incomes as public school teachers.
In many areas of the South, as I have said, attitudes are
changing and softening, as white parents discover there is
a level of token desegregation that is not intolerable to them.
This tendency, I feel certain, will increase year by year. But
I cannot yet foresee the day, in the greatest part of the
South, when white parents by and large will accept Negro
teachers and Negro principals over their children. This
would demand one more subtle and unwelcome shifting of
gears; it would carry the social revolution beyond the point
of an uneasy “equality” of pupils in a classroom, and would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
make the white child subject to Negro masters. The efforts
of a Federal court to compel employment of Negro teachers
who would preside over heavily “mixed” classrooms would
be bitterly resented, and the resentment would manifest
itself in wholesale withdrawals and school abandonments.
I venture the flat prediction, on the basis of personal conversations
with white families who have moved out of
Washington, that this difficulty would be seen as a last-straw
condition. But the alternative to the employment of
Negro teachers in massively desegregated schools is to discharge
the Negro teachers and to replace them with white
teachers. This would be cruelly unfair; but in any unhappy
election between preserving the jobs of some Negro schoolteachers
and preserving a local school system itself (which
involves preservation of the good will of white parents and
taxpayers), the jobs will go.</p>

<p>This line of discussion brings us to a fourth practical
difficulty that would accompany massive desegregation in
the South: the predictable difficulty in employing <em>white</em>
teachers for racially mixed classrooms. New York, Philadelphia,
and Washington have run into this constantly. Dr.
Hansen has disclosed in the <cite>Teachers’ College Record</cite> (October
1960) that Washington’s school system employed 579
temporary teachers in 1954-55. By 1959-60, this number
had grown to 1250. “It is difficult,” he concedes, “to find
white teachers psychologically prepared to take jobs in
predominantly Negro schools, with the result that the source
of applicants tends to become more and more restricted.”
And if Washington has this problem, with the high salaries
and fringe benefits and physical facilities and cultural amenities
it can offer a prospective teacher, what may we reasonably
expect at the branch-heads?</p>

<p>One of the problems in this area, acknowledged even by
Otto Klineberg, is the language barrier that so often baffles
a white teacher in attempting to communicate effectively
with a Negro child. “Obviously the Southern Negro speaks
English,” says Klineberg in <cite>Characteristics of the American
Negro</cite>, “but equally obviously, his English is not similar to,
or the equal of, the English spoken by the average white.”
Many other observers have made the same point. The Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
inflection, pronunciation, word-choice, and accent are quite
different; and in the case of the South Carolina gullah, these
characteristics make speech almost incomprehensible. White
teachers, with jobs widely available to them, simply would
rather not get involved in this.</p>

<p>These teachers have other objections, too. As the record
of hearings before a House subcommittee in 1956 makes
vividly clear, many white teachers are simply appalled by
the sexual mores and the violent attitudes of some of the
Negro pupils in desegregated schools. One witness after
another appeared before the committee to testify to the
inordinate amount of time that had to be spent simply in
maintaining discipline. Adolescent sex urges, volatile enough
under any circumstances, are further complicated by the
novelties and tensions of intimate interracial association in
halls and classrooms and toilets. Philadelphians still recall
grimly the incident at Shaw Junior High School in 1956,
when a Negro gang gathered outside the school to insult and
annoy pupils as they left the building. Three teachers who
came out to remonstrate were attacked and severely beaten.
The white principal of another Philadelphia school, who had
watched the deterioration of his school from an “honors”
institution of high scholarship into a second-rate vocational
factory, was quoted in <cite>U. S. News</cite> in 1958: “Many of these
youngsters are not adequately motivated for learning. They
have no home to speak of, nothing to encourage them once
they leave the school grounds. They’re here simply to occupy
their time until they’re old enough to go out and get a job&mdash;if
they can find a job.”</p>

<p>These are among the arguments of practicality the Southerner
would advance against compulsory desegregation of his
public schools. He is not prepared to chop logic, or to
engage in casuistic debate on the why of the world that he
lives in. He knows that with the best will in the world&mdash;and
in his fashion, he more often than not has great good will
for the Negroes of his community&mdash;he cannot quickly elevate
the Negro’s home environment appreciably. Overnight
he cannot put books and magazines in Negro living rooms;
he cannot inject generations of cultural background with
some magic hypodermic needle; he cannot deliver to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Negro, as he would loan him a hoe or give him an overcoat,
the social graces, the community of experience, the heritage
of generations, the accumulation of business, professional,
and civic understanding that necessarily must figure in the
educative process. Time presses, and the school bell rings,
and on April mornings the honk of the school bus, like the
voice of the turtle, is abroad in the land. He has to do what
he conceives to be best for his child <em>now</em>, to prepare that
child for the society he predictably will live in tomorrow.
And he does not accept the idea that racially mixed classrooms,
over a long period of years, in the context of the
only society he knows, will provide a workable, desirable,
or pleasant experience for sons and daughters who are dear
to him. Maybe, he says doubtfully, maybe some time in the
future....</p>

<p>If there ever is to be in the South any significant degree
of desegregation in public institutions, let alone any significant
degree of integration in society as a whole, it can come
effectively in one way only: slowly, cautiously, voluntarily,
“some time in the future.” This is the doctrine of “gradualism,”
and the Negro’s professional leaders despise it. They
insist, with some plausibility, that constitutional rights are personal
and immediate rights, capable of being lost irretrievably
if they are not exercised at once; and now that new constitutional
rights have been created and defined, they ask, why is
the realization of these rights coming so slowly? “How
long do you expect us to wait?” they demand. “It is almost
a hundred years since slavery now.” They do not want to
be gradual; they want to be integrated.</p>

<p>To these impatient appeals, the South makes a number
of responses, none of them pleasing to the militant Negro
leadership. But the responses make sense nonetheless. The
answers add up to this: The Negro is plunging forward now
in a movement that is at once both revolutionary and
evolutionary. All of man’s history suggests that while revolutionary
changes may be hurried and pushed along by processes
of forced growth, the changes that result from evolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
can never be hurried at all. They will come at their
own speed, and their own speed is glacial.</p>

<p>In many areas, the revolution proceeds apace. William
G. Carleton, of the University of Florida at Gainesville,
acknowledges “great strides” by the Southern Negro since
World War II. In 1944, Negroes were virtually barred from
participation in Southern politics. In 1960, when he reported
in the <cite>Teachers’ College Record</cite> that Negro rights were
making haste slowly, 1,100,000 Negroes were registered to
vote in Southern primaries and general elections. The number
is considerably higher in 1962, and the United States
Civil Rights Commission has conceded that except in a relatively
few Black Belt localities in Louisiana, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Georgia, Negroes now are not prevented
from registering or voting over most of the South. In most
areas, it is no longer the intimidation of the white man, but
far more often the indolence, indifference, and incapacity
of the Negro himself that keeps him from the polls. In
some Southern States, Negro registration has climbed to
35 or 40 per cent of the adult Negro population; white
registration, in many communities, is seldom much more
than half or two-thirds of the adult population. In Florida,
Negro registration increased from 8000 in 1944 to 160,000
in 1960. North Carolina and Virginia have witnessed gains
almost as notable. To Carleton, a “veritable revolution” is
seen in the South: “Had the mass of Southerners in 1950
been told that by 1960 there would be considerable token
desegregation in the schools of Virginia, Tennessee, North
Carolina, Arkansas, and Texas; even more desegregation on
city bus lines; and that segregation at lunch counters and
eating places would be here and there giving way in the
South, they would have refused flatly to believe it. From
the point of view of social justice, the changes have been
painfully slow and spotty; but from the point of view of
white Southern cultural attitudes, the changes have been unbelievably
swift.”</p>

<p>Note that the unbelievable changes of which Carleton
speaks are changes from “segregation” to “desegregation,”
in his own careful choice of nouns, and not changes from
“segregation” to “integration.” It takes no great powers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
prophecy to envision a great many other such changes, as
the South cautiously explores the possibilities of retaining
its segregation while abandoning it too. I write in a period
of transition. Ten years hence, in 1972, the perfect clarity
of hindsight will perceive much that is now obscure; but
my impression is that some sort of peak has been reached
by the white South with the crisis over the parks of Birmingham.
In the winter of 1961-62, a decision was reached by
officials to close the Birmingham parks rather than to accept
a policy of permitting their joint use by the two races, but
the decision brought the first audible rumblings of misgiving
and disagreement in a city that previously had been united
in opposition to the slightest retreat from policies of total
municipal segregation. A great many persons in Birmingham,
sincerely convinced of the wisdom of essential racial separation,
also were sincerely convinced of the desirability of
retaining the parks on a functioning basis. They were aware
that other Southern cities of comparable urbanity and custom
had adjusted to a system of open parks. They did not like
the idea of a parkless city; and they began actively to think
about all this.</p>

<p>To the devout believers in racial integration, it doubtless
appears incredible that Birmingham’s action could have
been taken in the first place, or that the wrongness of this
decision (in their eyes) should fail to be instantly apparent.
These impatient critics simply do not comprehend the depth
of Southern feelings; they are as totally unable to accept
the viewpoint of the typical white Southerner as the typical
white Southerner is totally unable to accept the viewpoint
of the Negro. In the course of time, each of these conflicting
viewpoints will be seen more clearly; and once seen, may
be understood and dealt with. But the process demands time,
time, and more time. The death of racial segregation, which
the integrationists see as a necessary end, will follow Caesar’s
prescription: It will come when it will come.</p>

<p>To any objective observer, it should be manifest that such
a time is not yet&mdash;not in the early 1960s. In one city after
another, North as well as South, the plain and palpable fact
is that where “integration” is pushed too rapidly&mdash;more
rapidly, that is, than the Negro community is prepared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
sustain it or the white community is prepared to accept it&mdash;a
reverse action has set in. The District of Columbia offers
a textbook example: Its public schools passed in eight years
from segregation to desegregation to a virtual resegregation,
as white families fled from mixed neighborhoods and mixed
schools. St. Louis has acknowledged the same experience:
William A. Kottmeyer, deputy superintendent of instruction
in St. Louis, told the National Conference of Editorial
Writers in October 1961 that St. Louis then had more actual
segregation in its schools than had existed prior to the
<em>Brown</em> decision. Of 130 elementary schools in St. Louis at
the time, only 36 were classified as mixed; 46 were all white,
and 48 all Negro. Nowhere in the South has school desegregation
been attempted under more favorable auspices
than in Louisville, yet in 1961-62 the trend back toward
resegregation was appearing there, too. Between 1950 and
1960, Baltimore experienced a net out-migration of 175,000
white persons, and a net in-migration of 41,000 nonwhite
persons. Dr. Houston R. Jackson, a Negro assistant superintendent
of Baltimore schools, said in the summer of 1961 that
Baltimore had more all-Negro schools at that time than it
had before desegregation began in the fall of 1954: “When
the Negroes in a school reach 50 per cent,” he added, “that’s
when the white teachers begin to ask for transfers.” And to
judge from accounts of school litigation in such Northern
localities as New Rochelle, N. Y., and Englewood, N. J.,
the antipathy of white persons to intimate and personal relationships
with Negro persons is not a wholly Southern
phenomenon. One satirical lexicographer, observing conditions
in Chicago, has defined integration as “the period which elapses
between the arrival of the first Negro and the departure of the
last white.” Manifestly, the resistance to a coerced racial
“equality” is wide and deep.</p>

<p>Why is this so? The answer, in blunt speech, is that the
Negro race, as a race, has not earned equality. And as I
have attempted to argue earlier, it is a feeble and evasive
response to accuse the white critic, in making that flat statement,
of emulating the child who shot his parents and then
pleaded for mercy as an orphan. The failure of the Negro
race, as a race, to achieve equality cannot be blamed wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
on white oppression. This is the excuse, the crutch, the
piteous and finally pathetic defense of Negrophiles unable
or unwilling to face reality. In other times and other places,
sturdy, creative, and self-reliant minorities have carved out
their own destiny; they have <em>compelled</em> acceptance on their
own merit; they have demonstrated those qualities of leadership
and resourcefulness and disciplined ambition that in
the end cannot ever be denied. But the Negro race, as a
race, has done none of this. “We do not <em>want</em> to be second-class
citizens,” cries James Farmer, national director of the
Congress for Racial Equality. But “wanting” is not enough.
It is a beginning; but it is no more than a beginning.</p>

<p>How is the Negro race, as a race, to earn the respect of
the white race as a race? I should imagine that a cultivation
of self-respect would offer an excellent starting place; and
I do not see much of this now. With a few notable exceptions,
most Negro spokesmen appear to spend their time condoning
and minimizing the characteristics that deprive their race
of a “first-class” reputation. Are Negro neighborhoods filthy?
The Negro, it is said, has no incentive to clean them up.
Why does this appalling rate of illegitimacy persist? The
Negro, it is said, must relieve the frustrations brought on by
segregation. Are Negro incomes generally low? It is all the
fault of the white man: He deprives the Negro of job
opportunities.</p>

<p>After so long a time, these repeated alibis grow stale. I
have an idea that some Negro defenders themselves have
ceased to believe in them. And I cherish the further idea
that a really massive, significant change in race relations will
not come until the Negro people develop leaders who will
ask themselves the familiar question, “Why are we treated
as second-class citizens?” and return a candid answer to it:
“Because all too often that is what we are.”</p>

<p>If the Negro people have the innate capacity that Montagu,
Clark, Comas, Boas and the others insist they have,
the Negro people in time will overcome every obstacle that
fate has put in their way. On their own initiative, as a
product of their own industry and skill, they will develop
the talents that command respect in the market place. They
will provide their own capital, build their own enterprises,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
sell their own wares, compete among themselves until they
have learned to compete in the whole wide world. They will
exert, within their own community, the moral leadership
necessary to reduce crime and illegitimacy. By participation
first in their own constructive public affairs they will prove
themselves capable of contributing actively to the civic,
social, and economic life of their counties, towns, and
cities. They will stop trying simply to imitate the white man;
they will discover themselves first, and if this inner self is
all that the liberal anthropologists assert it to be, the discovery
should lead to wondrous exploitation. <cite>Ebony</cite> magazine
made this same point editorially in 1959, when it
urged its readers to stop complaining about being referred
to as “Negro” or as “colored”: “The real problem is the man
called Negro. If he would spend as much time dignifying his
race as he does decrying its designation, if he would quit
worrying about the label and concentrate upon improving
the product, the stuff inside, the name would take care of
itself.”</p>

<p>This was sound advice, and one of the hopeful aspects
of the South in the early 1960s (there are not many) is
that a new generation of young Negroes may even act upon
it. Carleton remarks in his essay upon the increasing nationalization
of the Southern Negro, who now, more often than
not, has some Northern connections; and he says this:</p>

<p>“Not only has the Southern Negro been nationalized, he
has also developed his own propertied and business classes,
his own wealthy and middle classes. Every Southern city of
any size has a group of economically comfortable and relatively
independent lawyers, doctors, teachers, morticians,
contractors, insurance agents, and owners of small businesses&mdash;garages
and filling stations, restaurants, taverns, barber
shops, beauty parlors, stores, and so forth. These people
have education or considerable economic independence, or
both.”</p>

<p>In my own observation, this is quite true; the notable fact,
as yet unrecognized by many staunch Southern segregationists,
is that a new Negro is in fact emerging&mdash;the bright
young high school senior, the serious college student, the
impatient middle-class Negro couple, struggling for respectability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
and status. Their impact is yet to be wholly felt within
their own race, but it is being felt increasingly upon white
institutions; and as a consequence, as Carleton observes,
racial attitudes among white persons in certain parts of the
South <em>are</em> subtly changing. He terms this a “softening.” It
is sometimes a hardening, too, as white families, having long
cherished an affection for “their” Negroes, discover that
their charges prefer not to be known as Uncle Toms or
Aunt Jemimas; the disillusioned reaction, out of chagrin
and embarrassment, is to let them bail themselves out of
trouble, if that’s the way they want it. The relationship
changes. But if the Southern Negro is to find salvation at
all, he must find it in this trend to independence and maturity.
“The most important immediate force at work to emancipate
the Negro of the South,” says Carleton, “is the Southern
Negro himself. A great change has come over him. He is
no longer an Uncle Tom, or even the kind of Negro approved
of by Booker T. Washington. He now talks back.
He has a new self-respect, a new confidence, a new independence.
Increasingly he is depending less on Northern Negro
initiative and leadership and is supplying his own.” To the
extent that this prophecy is fulfilled&mdash;for all the bitter
incidents, severances, and failures that may be expected&mdash;the
upward and forward motion of the Negro will be
recorded.</p>

<p>“The fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we
are underlings.” The brooding, introspective advice of Cassius
ought not to be spurned; it ought rather to be put to
thoughtful use by those genuinely (as distinguished from
merely politically) concerned with the Negroes’ movement
out of an underling’s status. James B. Conant has recognized
this, however belatedly, in his <cite>Slums and Suburbs</cite>.
Here Dr. Conant paints a grimly realistic picture of a Negro
child’s life in the urban slums of the North, where the child
may live six flights up in a tenement offering “one filthy
room with a bed, a light bulb, and a stink.” It is after visiting
such tenements, and inspecting the schools attended by
slum children, that he grows impatient “with both critics
and defenders of public education who ignore the realities of
school situations to engage in fruitless debate about educational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
philosophy, purposes, and the like: These situations
call for action, not for hair-splitting arguments.”</p>

<p>Dr. Conant is a distinguished spokesman for liberalism,
but unlike most of his fastidious brethren, he came to the
slums, and smelled them, and began to see realities fair and
clear. What he has to say about Negro education merits a
sober hearing. He is convinced that it is wrong to insist upon
a curriculum completely unsuited to the needs of the children
required to take it: “Foreign languages in Grade 7
or algebra in Grade 8 ... have little place in a school in
which half the pupils in that grade read at the fourth-grade
level or below. Homework has little relevance in a situation
where home is a filthy, noisy tenement.” By the same token,
it may be suggested that in the rural South, school offerings
ought to be adapted to real life also; and though Dr. Conant
is a staunch opponent of school segregation as such&mdash;that
is, to the assignment of pupils to schools solely by reason
of their race&mdash;he sees no reason why satisfactory education
cannot be provided in all Negro schools. Arbitrarily to shift
children around, simply to satisfy sociological theories of an
ideal race-mixture, impressed Dr. Conant as wrong. This
approach treats children “as though they were pawns on a
chessboard.”</p>

<p>But these children, white and black, are not mere pawns
on a chessboard, and whatever the sins or submissions of
their great-grandfathers may have been, they merit consideration
in their own right. In the South, this consideration
steadily is being extended. If we of the South cannot turn
the clock back to 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment
was ratified, at least we can strive to turn the clock back
to 1896, when the doctrine of separate but equal school
facilities received a sort of casual endorsement from a
Supreme Court concerned primarily with a question of public
transportation. True, the apostles of the Brave New World
will denounce the idea of applying the constitutional principles
of 1896 to problems of the early 1960s, but there
have been entirely too many such denunciations from thoughtless
and ill-informed pedagogues. The Negro (precisely as
the white) is entitled, so far as a system of education is
concerned, to the same educational opportunities afforded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
his white counterpart, and neither more nor less. What he
does with these educational opportunities thereafter is his
question to answer.</p>

<p>I do not profess to know what the future holds for the
Southern Negro, or for that matter, for the Northern Negro.
The achievements of the colored people of the 1950s merit
at least provisional applause: They are fighting their way
out of millennial shadows&mdash;and more power to them! If an
arriving generation of Negro children can sustain this momentum,
the race should move ahead, first within itself, as
Dr. Conant pleads, and in time&mdash;<em>in time</em>&mdash;toward equality
with the larger and more established community around it.
When that hour of equality arrives&mdash;whenever that hour arrives&mdash;white
“prejudices” predictably will dissolve; there
no longer would be a basis for them. What comes thereafter
I cannot suggest, but it is reasonable to surmise that barriers
once lowered will not thereafter be raised capriciously again.
When the Negro race proves itself, in terms of Western
values of maturity and achievement, it will be time enough
to talk of complete social and economic integration. Until
then, it is pointless to argue sociology; it is more useful,
in every way, to meditate upon the transcendent issues of
the law.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
</div>

<p>On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court of the United
States handed down its unanimous decision in the <em>School
Segregation Cases</em>. By general agreement, this decision is
regarded as the court’s most momentous opinion of this
century; indeed, only the court’s opinion of 1856 in the
<em>Dred Scott</em> case is thought to have had greater impact upon
the American people or upon the course of historic events.
Because of its destructive effect upon the stability of law
and the permanence of long-established institutions, the
school decision, in my own view, surpassed <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Sanford</em>
in the area of jurisprudence gone mad. In one stroke, the
Warren court violated those precepts of judicial restraint
and constitutional interpretation which it most frequently
has insisted on in the past; it transformed itself into a
super-legislature&mdash;more, it usurped the functions of constitutional
amendment that lie with not fewer than three-fourths
of the States. Abandoning law, the court wedded sociology;
discarding eighty years of unbroken precedent, members of
the court substituted their own notions of psychology and
moral fitness for the plain and palpable meaning of the
Fourteenth Amendment in terms of racially separate public
schools. And having prohibited unto the States the exercise
of a power the States had been exercising with judicial approval
since 1868, the court capped its day’s work by decreeing
an end to segregation in schools of the District of
Columbia. This latter stroke was achieved by judicial <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
de main</i> that left even the court’s best friends embarrassed;
what happened, Ralph Catterall has remarked, is that the
court declared “unthinkable” that which had been universally
thought for 166 years.</p>

<p>This is the indictment the South brings against the Warren
court for <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em> and the subsequent
judicial progeny of that May afternoon. In one sense, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
doubtless is futile to reargue <em>Brown</em>; as the court defiantly
indicated by its unprecedented action in signing every judge’s
name in 1958 to <em>Cooper</em> v. <em>Aaron</em>, the principles it boldly
put forward in 1954 are not to be reconsidered so long as
the court’s present members may live. But it is important,
nonetheless, that the South’s protest be understood and regularly
renewed, lest it be supposed that with the passage of
time the court’s action has been condoned and forgiven.</p>

<p>The South’s position rests upon a foundation of law,
history, and constitutional construction as old as the Union
itself. Ours is the ancient doctrine of State powers&mdash;not of
State rights, but of State <em>powers</em>. This principle is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan
vital</i> of the American Republic; it takes in the whole body
of governmental and philosophical principles by which
American greatness has been achieved. The doctrine embraces
that delicate balance in State and Federal relations
which keeps the whole watchworks moving; it depends for
its success upon the right of the States to be wrong&mdash;to be
foolish, to be unwise, to be out of step, to do “those acts
and things which independent States may of right do,”
simply because they are States. And unless this delicate
balance is preserved, and the rightful powers of the States
guarded from continued encroachment, the whole organism
of American government will be subtly transformed, without
the expressed consent of the people governed, from the
federalism that has provided its greatest strength to an immoderate
centralism that will prove its greatest weakness.
In maintaining its case, the South is no longer fighting the
question of separate schools or even a question of race relations
at all; it is contending, rather, for the preservation of
an American plan of value to all the States and all the
people. What is lost to the Southern States, in terms of
political powers, is lost to all States; and the imposition of
court-ordered prohibitions in one field makes the next imposition
that much easier. By the court’s decree of 1954,
the South’s largest, most expensive, most important, most
cherished public institutions&mdash;our public schools&mdash;were
thrown into potential jeopardy and chaos. Whose most
cherished institutions will be next?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The South’s legal position in the school controversy is
essentially a constitutional position; it cannot be fully understood
without some understanding of how the Southerner
views the Constitution. He views it through the eyes of the
States. These are to him, as Oliver Wolcott of Connecticut
called them, “the pillars which uphold the general system.”</p>

<p>Most readers of this essay, it may be assumed, have a good
working knowledge of the Constitution. Some will not; they
may never have read the Constitution, line by line and word by
word; they know its provisions vaguely, not explicitly, and
the trail that led from the creation of States to the formation
of a Union is as remote to them as a path through the
Pleiades. Hence this hornbook review. And if Jefferson’s
Declaration of Independence seems irrelevant to the South’s
position in <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, it is only because
too much emphasis has been put on the Declaration’s first
few lines and not enough on its last.</p>

<p>Perhaps in the divine plan, all men are indeed “created
equal.” Here on earth they patently are not. Jefferson’s opening
hyperbole was never meant to be taken literally. But he did
mean for the closing lines to be taken, at international law, for
precisely what they were&mdash;a declaration that the colonies once
tied to Britain, were now <em>free and independent States</em>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">and that as Free and Independent States, they have full
power to levy War, contract Alliances, establish Commerce
and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent
States may of right do.</p>
</div>

<p>In that moving Declaration, nothing was said of the birth
of a “nation.” In truth, nothing was said of a “nation” in
the Articles of Confederation, or in the Constitution that
succeeded the Articles. The Declaration was the act of “one
People,” but the political aim in the decade that followed
the Declaration of 1776 was to form a more perfect Union&mdash;a
union of separate, sovereign States, acting jointly for
some purposes, but acting individually for others. And the
political genius of the founding architects who designed this
structure is the very genius so widely disdained by the busy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
planners and amateur carpenters of our own time.</p>

<p>What did the Declaration assert the function of government
to be? Why is it that governments are instituted
among men? The answer, in Jefferson’s phrase, is that governments
are instituted among men to <em>secure rights</em>&mdash;not
to grant rights, which a free people have to begin with, but
only to secure rights. And where does government derive
its powers in this regard? It derives its just powers “from
the Consent of the Governed,” and from no other source.
How is this consent manifested? The answer lies in the whole
of the republican process, which in the United States is a
process exercised entirely through the actions of the people
<em>in their States</em>.</p>

<p>The colonists who cast off the yoke of Great Britain did
not propose to take on a fresh yoke of their own contriving
in its place. The sum of their charges against the Crown
was that George III had sought to establish “an absolute
tyranny over these States.” He had “erected a multitude of
New Offices and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our
People and eat out their Substance.” In the formation of a
new and independent government, the founding fathers were
determined to minimize the opportunities for new tyranny
to come into power. And toward that end, they were determined
that the powers of government should be fragmented,
and partitioned off, and kept securely under leash. They
feared excessive “bigness” for the best of all reasons, that
excessive bigness ought always to be feared when the liberties
of a people are at stake. They sought to provide a check
here, a balance there, a string of unequivocal prohibitions
somewhere else. They insisted always upon a reservation to
the people themselves of powers ungranted. These were the
prudent goals the greatest political minds of our country
sought to achieve.</p>

<p>Their first handiwork, the Articles of Confederation, is too
much denounced and too little read. “This despised government,”
said Patrick Henry, defending the Confederation,
“merits, in my opinion, the highest encomium: It carried us
through a long and dangerous war; it rendered us victorious
in that bloody conflict with a powerful nation; it has secured
us a territory greater than any European monarch possesses;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and shall a government which has been thus strong and vigorous
be accused of imbecility and abandoned for want of
energy?” It is popularly supposed that when the delegates
assembled at Philadelphia in 1787, they tossed the whole of
the Articles unceremoniously aside, and set out from scratch
to compose a Constitution. They did nothing of the sort. The
revisions they made were fundamental, of course, but the
principles of political power under which the United States
live today are in essence the principles embodied in the Articles
of Confederation.</p>

<p>Here in the Articles are to be found many of the phrases,
and indeed, many of the specific provisions, that endure in
the Constitution. The genesis of the Tenth Amendment appears
as the first substantive clause in the compact: “Each
State retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and
every Power, Jurisdiction and right, which is not by this confederation
expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress
assembled.”</p>

<p>Article III bound the States in a firm league of friendship
“for their common defense, the security of their Liberties, and
their mutual and general welfare”; the phrases were to reappear
in the preamble to the Constitution of 1787. Article IV
guaranteed to the inhabitants of each State “all privileges
and immunities of free citizens in the several States,” a
guarantee carried over to Article IV, Section 2. The extradition
of fugitives from one State to another, the rule of “full
faith and credit” among the States, the immunity of Congressmen,
and the flat prohibition upon the granting of titles
of nobility all stem from the Articles. It often is forgotten,
but the States laid upon themselves in the Articles of Confederation
many of the prohibitions they were to accept a
few years later in the Constitution: No States were to enter
into any compact without the consent of Congress; no States
were to keep troops or ships of war in time of peace without
the consent of Congress “unless such State be actually invaded
by enemies, or ... the danger is so imminent as not
to admit of delay,” a provision echoed to this day, almost
exactly, in Article I, Section 10. The powers vested in the
Congress under the Articles of Confederation also have a
familiar ring&mdash;to coin money, fix standards of weights and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
measures, regulate trade, establish post offices, borrow money,
build and equip a navy, and appropriate funds “for defraying
the public expenses.”</p>

<p>But the Articles of Confederation, for all the thoughtful
provisions they provided as progenitors of the Constitution,
had serious and admitted defects as well. If there was to be
something more than a “firm league of friendship” among
sovereign States, a government had to be created capable of
acting upon individuals as such. The most devoted friend of
“States’ rights” willingly concedes that the “more perfect
Union” provided for in the Constitution of 1787 created a
nation, even if the Constitution described it only as a
“Union,” or as “the land.” Obviously, the supremacy clause
in Article VI was something new, not in degree, but in kind:
“This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which
shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or
which shall be made, under the authority of the United
States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges
in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution
or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

<p>That clause alone, coupled with Article III and with John
Marshall’s effective establishment of the principle of judicial
review, created the “one out of many” that is the American
Republic. Yet the objective student of public affairs who
would understand the South’s classic and traditional position
in advocacy of States’ rights should devote some thoughtful
attention to certain aspects of the Constitution that have
remained unchanged from the very beginning of the Union,
surviving civil war and the growth of nearly two centuries&mdash;aspects
that remain unchanged to this day.</p>

<p>At the risk of being tedious, it is necessary to examine
the Constitution as it is, and not as centralizers might wish
it to be. This is our organic law, the basis of our public institutions;
the spirit that lives and breathes in it is the American
spirit, and the great beams and foundation stones of this written
compact support the whole structure of our government.
The few paragraphs that follow may seem elementary. They
are, in fact, essential to an appreciation of what was wrong
with <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em> in 1954.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<p>The preamble itself offers the first source of misunderstanding.
It begins, of course, “We the people of the United
States,” and for 175 years superficial students of the Constitution
have been crying triumphantly that the opening three
words prove the existence of some national democracy: “We,
the people.” The demonstrable facts prove no such thing. On
Monday, August 6, 1787, the Philadelphia convention received
its first full draft of a Constitution. The preamble submitted
by South Carolina’s John Rutledge on that day read
as follows: “We the people of the States of New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
and Georgia, do ordain, declare and establish the following
Constitution for the Government of Ourselves and our Posterity.”
The preamble in this form was adopted the following
day without dissent, and indeed without debate. It was not
until September 10, when the weary delegates were ready to
have the final document whipped into form by a committee
on style, that the presumptuousness of the draft preamble
became apparent. James Wilson of Pennsylvania made the
point that it would be “worse than folly to rely on the concurrence
of Rhode Island.” The State of New York, he observed,
“has not been represented for a long time past in the
Convention.” North Carolina’s agreement was most uncertain.
Many individuals from other States had spoken against
the plan. And though Wilson was here addressing himself to
a specific proposal that the draft Constitution be submitted
first to the Congress, rather than directly to the States, his
remarks made obvious good sense to members of the committee
on style. They prudently recast the preamble to omit
all mention of specific States&mdash;how could they know which
nine would bind themselves by ratification?&mdash;and the preamble
emerged as we know it. The point is that there was
not the slightest doubt in the minds of the delegates at Philadelphia,
or in the minds of the State conventions thereafter,
that “We the people” meant, as Madison said, “We the
people of the States as thirteen sovereignties.”</p>

<p>The first eight words of Article I are important: “All legislative
powers herein granted shall be vested....” We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
dealing, at the outset, as the careful choice of a noun makes
clear, with <em>powers</em>, and with a specific kind of power: <em>legislative</em>
power. These powers are “granted <em>herein</em>,” which is to
say, granted by the ratifying States in the Constitution itself,
and in no other place; and these powers are to be “vested”
(a most judicious verb) in the Congress.</p>

<p>In Section 2 of Article I, the first of more than ninety references
to “the States” appears: The House of Representatives
is to be composed of members chosen every second year
“by the people of the several States.” No congressional district
ever may extend across a State line, for “the electors in
each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors
of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.” Moreover,
every Representative must be “an inhabitant of that
State in which he shall be chosen.” Then follows the enumeration
of the States to whom the Constitution would be
submitted, if they wished to enter the Union: The State of
New Hampshire shall be entitled to choose three members of
the House, Massachusetts eight, and so forth.</p>

<p>Section 3 deals with composition of the Senate. A preposition
is important here: To become a Senator, a man must be
an inhabitant of that State <em>for</em> which he shall be chosen.
From the beginning, the concept has been that Representatives
represent people, or groups of people, or districts of
people; Senators speak for the larger, mystical entity of the
States themselves.</p>

<p>Section 4 re-emphasizes the status and function of the
States, even as it lays down the first of the limitations upon
State power voluntarily accepted by the ratifying members of
the Union: “The times, places and manner of holding elections
for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed
in each State by the legislature thereof: But the Congress
may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except
as to the place of choosing Senators.”</p>

<p>In Section 5, the first of many limitations upon the central
government appears: Each house of the Congress must keep
a journal of its proceedings, and at the desire of one-fifth of
the members present, must record the individual yeas and
nays. Close study of the Constitution will disclose many such
restrictive provisions, for the Constitution is in many respects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
a negative instrument; almost every delegation of power is
followed at once by a snatching back, or by a qualification,
or by a jealous and suspicious prohibition. The Constitution
abounds in reservations, in neithers, noes, and buts.</p>

<p>Section 8 defines the powers of the Congress, and characteristically
limits these powers even as it grants them: The
Congress may lay and collect taxes, “But all duties ... shall
be uniform throughout the United States”; the Congress may
raise and support armies, “but no appropriation of money to
that use shall be for a longer term than two years”; the Congress
may provide for organizing and arming the militia, “reserving
to the States respectively the appointment of the officers”;
the Congress shall exercise exclusive power over the
seat of the national government, but its purchase of other
places is dependent upon “the consent of the legislature of
the State in which the same shall be.”</p>

<p>In Section 9, one of the clauses appears that the Supreme
Court was to forget in 1954&mdash;a provision specifically recognizing
and sanctioning the institution of slavery as a custom
in no way violative of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee that
no person may be deprived of his liberty without due process
of law. No friend of the court yet has been able to explain
exactly how a constitutional provision that did not prohibit
slavery could be interpreted to prohibit racially separate but
equal public schools in the District of Columbia. No matter.
The more significant provisions of Section 9 go to the nine
flat prohibitions therein placed upon the Congress. Here the
States laid down the law to the joint government they were
creating: The Congress could not (1) interfere with the importation
of slaves prior to 1808; (2) suspend the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus; (3) pass a bill of attainder or
(4) an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex post facto</span> law; (5) impose a direct tax except
in proportion to the census; (6) place a tax or duty on articles
exported from any State; (7) give preference in any regulation
of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State
over those of another; (8) draw money from the Treasury
except as a consequence of appropriations made by law, or
(9) grant titles of nobility.</p>

<p>Section 10 follows with fourteen prohibitions the States
agreed to put upon themselves by the Constitution. No State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
may (1) enter into a treaty or confederation; (2) grant letters
of marque and reprisal; (3) coin money; (4) emit bills
of credit; (5) make anything but gold and silver coin legal
tender; (6) pass any bill of attainder or (7) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex post facto</span>
law or (8) law impairing the obligation of contracts; (9)
grant any title of nobility; or, without the consent of the
Congress, (10) lay any duty on imports or exports; (11)
lay any duty of tonnage; (12) keep troops or ships of war in
time of peace; (13) enter into any compact with another
State, or (14) engage in war unless actually invaded or in
such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.</p>

<p><em>Article II.</em> The provisions of the Constitution dealing with
the election and office of the President are significant in this
brief review because of the indispensable function that is
assigned to the States as States, even in the choice of a President.
As a matter of law, the popular vote that is cast for
presidential candidates in the Republic as a whole is meaningless.
What counts, plainly, is the vote within each State,
for this choice by the people within their State by custom
governs the action of presidential electors who are appointed
in each State “in such manner as the legislature thereof may
direct.” And should the presidential electors fail to give any
one candidate a majority of their votes, the election goes
immediately to the House of Representatives where the votes
shall be taken “by States, the representation from each State
having one vote.”</p>

<p>The federal nature of our Union also is made apparent in
the provisions of Section 2, which leave to the States the
command of their own militia except “when called into the
actual service of the United States,” and vest in the Senate
a powerful control upon the executive power of the President.
It is only with the advice and consent of the Senate that the
President may make treaties, appoint ambassadors, and name
judges of the Supreme Court and other officers. And the consent
of Senators, to repeat, in a very real sense is the consent
of the States as such.</p>

<p><em>Article III.</em> The Constitution vests the judicial power of the
United States (with such exceptions, and under such regulations
as the Congress shall make) in one Supreme Court and
in the inferior tribunals established by law. The chief point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the advocate of States’ rights might emphasize here is that
the high court’s power is entirely <em>judicial</em> in nature; its jurisdiction
extends to cases in law and equity arising under the
Constitution, under Federal law, and under treaties made
under the authority of the United States, and to “controversies”
in which a State as such, or diversity of citizenship
on the part of litigants, may play a part.</p>

<p>Section 2 makes clear that the States must be considered
separate entities in the trial of crimes, just as they are considered
separate entities in the election of Congressmen:
Crimes are to be tried “in the State where the said crimes
shall have been committed.”</p>

<p><em>Article IV.</em> All four sections of the Fourth Article are concerned
with the States, their citizens, their obligations to
other States, and their rights as members of the Federal
Union. Here is the provision that “full faith and credit shall
be given in each State to the public acts, records and judicial
proceedings of every other State.” The second section explicitly
acknowledges State citizenship as distinct from United
States citizenship. It says that “the citizens of each State shall
be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the
several States.” This section also provides for the extradition
of persons charged with crime, and prior to the Thirteenth
Amendment, for the compulsory return of fugitive slaves.
Section 3 protects the States from having new States carved
out of their territory. Section 4 guarantees “to every State in
this Union a republican form of government.”</p>

<p><em>Article V.</em> The brief provision dealing with amendment of
the Constitution is of paramount importance in any understanding
of the South’s protest against the school decision.
John Taylor of Caroline once defined sovereignty as “the
will to enact, the power to execute.” John Marshall spoke in
the <em>Cohens</em> case of the “supreme and irresistible power to
make and unmake.” Article V defines and locates this supreme
power&mdash;not in “the whole body of the people,” as
Marshall carelessly remarked, but in “three-fourths of the
several States.”</p>

<p>The scheme for amendment of the Constitution goes to
the very essence of what makes the American Union great
and unique among the powers of the earth: We do not accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the supremacy of “majority rule.” If there is one ancient
parliamentary principle to which the Constitution does <em>not</em>
subscribe, it is the principle of majority rule. In every major
question touched upon in the Constitution&mdash;for the impeachment
of officers, the overriding of a veto, the ratification of a
treaty, the proposing and adopting of amendments to the
Constitution&mdash;in all of these, mere majorities are not enough.
Some margin of more than a majority is required. And when
it comes to changing the Constitution itself, the explicit provision
is that no change can be made without the expressed
and tacit approval of at least three-fourths <em>of the States</em>. The
laws, customs, desires, preferences of a minority of the States
are not to be blindly overthrown by any 51 per cent of the
people; and until the <em>Brown</em> case came along, it was not
imagined in the South that Article V could be suspended, and
the Constitution effectively amended, by the will of nine
judges.</p>

<p>The substance of Article VI has been quoted earlier, and
the concluding Article VII is notable chiefly for the light it
sheds upon the relationship of the States to one another within
the Federal Union: “The ratification of the conventions of
nine States,” it says, “shall be sufficient for the establishment
of this Constitution <em>between the States so ratifying the same</em>.”
The language plainly justifies what sometimes is referred to
disparagingly as “the compact theory,” as if a concept of the
Constitution as a compact “between the States so ratifying the
same” were no more than a gauzy illusion of Calhounian
metaphysicians. The Constitution is in fact, as even Mr. Justice
Douglas has described it, a “compact between sovereigns”
(<em>New York</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 362 U. S. 572). The
United States of America, as a corporate being, came into
existence with New Hampshire’s ratification as the ninth
State on June 21, 1788. If Virginia, New York, North Carolina,
and Rhode Island thereafter had failed to ratify (the
vote was 89 to 79 in Virginia, 30 to 27 in New York, and
34 to 32 nearly two full years later in Rhode Island), they
might be to this day sovereign and independent States, small
nations, republics in their own regard. It was by their own
voluntary actions that the States accepted the Constitution
and agreed to be bound by it. As partners in a joint venture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
they entered into compact; and the Constitution was, and is,
the written instrument by which their mutual understanding
is set down, not to be altered without the consent of three-fourths
of them.</p>

<p>The ratifying conventions, especially those in the key States
of Virginia and New York, provide abundant documentation
of the prophetic vision with which the Founding Fathers
sought to protect their infant Republic from the predictable
excesses of “big government.” Our nation was created in an
abiding sense of distrust; most of <cite>The Federalist</cite> papers are
devoted toward soothing and allaying the fears of those who
apprehended that one day the central government would get
out of hand. “Suspicion is a virtue,” cried Patrick Henry in
the Virginia convention, “as long as its object is the preservation
of the public good, and as long as it stays within
proper bounds.... Guard with jealous attention the public
liberty! Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel!... I
shall be told I am continually afraid; but, Sir, I have strong
cause of apprehension. In some parts of the plan before you,
the great rights of freemen are endangered, in other parts
absolutely taken away.... But we are told that we need not
fear, because those in power, being our representatives, will
not abuse the powers we put in their hands. I am not well
versed in history, but I will submit to your recollection,
whether liberty has been destroyed most often by the licentiousness
of the people, or by the tyranny of rulers?”</p>

<p>To put at rest these widespread fears of excessive centralism,
the ratifying States demanded a series of explicit amendments
to the Constitution, intended to place further express
prohibitions upon the Congress. These amendments became,
of course, the Bill of Rights; and important as the first eight
amendments are, the forgotten Ninth and Tenth speak with
telling eloquence of the nature of our political institutions.
The Ninth asserts that “the enumeration in the Constitution
of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage
others retained by the people.” And the Tenth, once insisted
upon by New York as positively as by Virginia, declares in
words too clear possibly to be misunderstood that “the powers
not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.”</p>

<p>There in the Tenth Amendment is the key that should
unlock all mysteries of construction, wherever the State and
Federal relationship is at issue. It does not treat of “rights.”
Rights belong to people, and are retained by them in the
Ninth. The Tenth deals with powers, and its careful wording
spells out the essence of our Union. The Congress has no
powers whatever, save those the States have delegated to it
“by the Constitution.” If authority for some congressional act
cannot be found in the Constitution, the authority does not
exist, for the Congress has no implied or inherent powers; its
powers begin and end with the powers enumerated in the
written instrument itself&mdash;including, to be sure, the power to
adopt “necessary and proper” laws to put the powers to work.
All other powers, not prohibited to the States <em>by the Constitution</em>,
are expressly reserved to the States respectively, or to
the people.</p>

<p>There is great meaning here for the issue that prompts this
brief. What the South has said, repeatedly, earnestly, unavailingly,
is that the power to operate public schools plainly is a
power reserved to the States respectively <em>by the Constitution</em>.
The power is not delegated to the United States; it is not
prohibited to the States by the Constitution; therefore it remains
with them. The power to operate public schools necessarily
embraces the power to decide what kind of public
schools will be operated; and so long as the States do not
violate any prohibition laid upon them by the Constitution,
they are free to operate whatever schools they please. Their
contention is that nothing in the original Constitution of
1788, nothing in the pre-War amendments, nothing in the
Reconstruction amendments, and nothing added to the Constitution
in this century was intended to prohibit to the States
the power to operate racially separate public schools. On the
contrary, the South contends that this power plainly was recognized,
acknowledged, and judicially sanctioned in States
North and South for eighty years after the Fourteenth
Amendment became operative; and we deny that a construction
so long placed upon the Constitution, in an area of public
affairs so vitally and intimately affecting the daily lives of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
so many millions of persons, validly may be wiped out by a
stroke of judicial pens.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The four cases that were to coalesce as <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of
Education</em> had their beginnings in four widely separated proceedings.
In the first of the suits, Harry Briggs, Jr., and forty-five
other Negro children of Clarendon County, S. C.,
brought an action on December 22, 1950, against R. W.
Elliott and other members of the county’s School District 22.
The following March, in Kansas, Oliver Brown and other
colored children filed suit against Topeka’s board of education.
In May 1951, Dorothy E. Davis and other Negro plaintiffs
in Prince Edward County, Va., launched their proceeding
against county officials. Nine months later, in the early
spring of 1952, Ethel Louise Belton and others sued for
nondiscriminatory admission to the public schools of Hockessin
and Wilmington, Del.</p>

<p>Each of the suits was carefully coordinated with the others
by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, and each had the same object&mdash;overthrow of the
“separate but equal” rule that had governed the operation of
racially separate schools since Reconstruction days. Counsel’s
plan was to show, first, that school facilities for white
and Negro children were not equal as a matter of fact, but
this was not so important; beyond this&mdash;and it was by far
the more significant aim&mdash;the object was to prove, as Thurgood
Marshall said in South Carolina, that “the segregation
of pupils in and of itself is a form of inequality,” and hence
a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s requirement of
equal protection of the law.</p>

<p>The Clarendon County case, which came on for trial before
a three-judge Federal court in Charleston May 28-29,
1951, provided the pattern. The pleadings were drafted by
Marshall himself and by Robert L. Carter of New York, the
two top lawyers for the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People. (In 1961, Marshall became a
Federal circuit judge.)</p>

<p>The facts were not in great dispute. At that time, there
were in Clarendon County as a whole 6500 Negro children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
and 2375 white children. District 22 had 684 Negro elementary
pupils and 150 Negro high school pupils, plus 102
white elementary pupils and 34 white high school pupils. The
Negro pupils of District 22 went to three schoolhouses: Scott
Branch (a combined elementary and high school), Liberty
Hill, and Rambay. All the white pupils went to the Summerton
elementary and high school. It was shown that the
facilities for white children, though old (the Summerton high
school was built in 1907), were in many respects far superior
to the facilities for the Negro children. The two-room
Rambay School and the four-room Liberty Hill School had
no running water, and Rambay had no electric power. The
Negro schools had few of the educational aids provided at
Summerton; their playgrounds were inferior; toilet facilities
at the two smaller buildings were outside privies. County
officials pointed out that neither water nor sewage lines existed
in the area of the two schools; in the remote rural section
served by Rambay, no electric power was available to anyone;
the library for colored pupils at Scott Branch, they said,
was superior to the library for white pupils at Summerton;
and they denied any discrimination in transportation, janitorial
services, and other amenities. As the case went to trial,
however, counsel for Clarendon County confessed a general
inequality in physical facilities, described a State-wide plan
instituted by Governor Byrnes for school improvements, and
pledged a prompt effort to achieve equality.</p>

<p>By far the most significant evidence in the Clarendon
County case came from a group of witnesses summoned by
the plaintiffs to testify on the psychological effects of segregation
itself. Kenneth Clark, assistant professor of psychology
at the New York City College, was a key figure in this phase
of the NAACP’s assault. In the <cite>Teachers’ College Record</cite> for
October 1960, he revealingly describes the fashion in which
he was approached by Carter in February 1951, on behalf of
the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, to prepare exhibits and
test findings that would support the plaintiffs’ side in the
School Segregation Cases. Carter wanted material that would
show how “segregation inflicts psychological damage on its
victims,” and Clark collaborated with the lawyers in preparing
psychological data “to be used in whatever ways they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
believed most effective in the presentation of their case.” As
part of the plan, Clark himself went to Clarendon County,
and administered the “doll test” to twenty-six Negro children;
in this test, the subjects are shown two dolls identical
except for skin coloring&mdash;one doll is white, the other brown.
They then are asked which doll they like best, which doll is
“nice,” which doll is “bad,” and which doll “is like you?”
From the answers to these questions, Clark testified in the
Clarendon case, “we get some picture of the child’s concept
of his own color, and we also get an indication of the child’s
anxieties and confusions about his color and his feelings.”
Not surprisingly, the twenty-six pupils Clark tested in Clarendon
County were found to have been “definitely harmed in
the development of their personalities.”</p>

<p>Other witnesses for the plaintiffs included Harold McNalley,
associate professor of education at Columbia Teachers
College; Ellis O. Knox, professor of education at Howard
University; James L. Hupp, professor of education and
psychology at Wesleyan College of West Virginia; David
Krech, professor of social psychology at Harvard; and Mrs.
Helen Trager, a lecturer in psychology at Vassar. Their
testimony, admitted over defense objections that it was irrelevant
and immaterial, was intended to support the plaintiffs’
primary contention that segregation, in and of itself,
caused emotional damage to the Negro child, and that
segregated schools could never be made “equal” as a matter
of law.</p>

<p>On June 23, 1951, the Fourth Circuit’s Chief Judge
John J. Parker, joined by District Judge George Bell Timmerman,
handed down an opinion in the Clarendon County
case. The third member of the court, District Judge J.
Waties Waring, strongly dissented to the Parker-Timmerman
decision. The majority decree directed county officials to
proceed at once with genuine equalization of public school
facilities, but the court refused to upset the long-standing
doctrine of “separate but equal.” The late Judge Parker was
one of the nation’s most widely admired jurists, a North
Carolinian who had then had more than twenty-five years’
experience on the bench. His opinion (98 F. Supp. 529),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
though it subsequently was to be reversed, merits respectful
consideration in any study of the South’s position.</p>

<p>On the key question developed by the plaintiffs&mdash;that
segregation in itself is a denial of equal protection&mdash;Parker
took a calmly judicial approach: This is a “matter of legislative
policy for the several States,” he said, “with which
the Federal courts are powerless to interfere.” He continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">One of the great virtues of our constitutional system is
that, while the Federal government protects the fundamental
rights of the individual, it leaves to the several States
the solution of local problems. In a country with a great
expanse of territory, with peoples of widely differing
customs and ideas, local self government in local matters
is essential to the peace and happiness of the people in
the several communities as well as to the strength and
unity of the country as a whole. It is universally held,
therefore, that each State shall determine for itself, subject
to the observance of the fundamental rights and
liberties guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, how it
shall exercise the police power, i.e., the power to legislate
with respect to the safety, morals, health and general
welfare. And in no field is this right of the several States
more clearly recognized than in that of public education.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Judge Parker quoted from an opinion by the District of
Columbia’s Judge E. B. Prettyman, an outstanding jurist who
had considered the question a year earlier in <em>Carr</em> v. <em>Corning</em>
(182 F.2d 14). There Judge Prettyman raised the question
of whether the Fourteenth Amendment had lifted the
entire problem of race relations out of the hands of all
legislatures and settled it. “We do not think it did,” he said.
“Such problems lie naturally in the field of legislation, a
method susceptible of experimentation, of development, of
adjustment to the current necessities in a variety of community
circumstance. We do not believe that the makers of
the first ten amendments in 1789 or of the Fourteenth
Amendment in 1866 meant to foreclose legislative treatment
of the problem in this country. This is not to decry efforts
to reach that state of common existence which is the obvious
highest good in our concept of civilization. It is merely
to say that the social and economic inter-relationship of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
races living together is a legislative problem, as yet not
solved, and is not a problem solved fully, finally or unequivocally
by a fiat enacted many years ago. We must
remember that on this particular point we are interpreting
a Constitution and not enacting a statute.”</p>

<p>Judge Parker went on in his own opinion to review
decisions of the Supreme Court sustaining the separate-but-equal
doctrine, and to distinguish between education at the
graduate-school level and education at the elementary-school
level. In dealing with the grammar schools, under systems
of compulsory attendance, local lawmakers have problems
of educational policy that must take into account not only
questions of instruction “but also of the wishes of the parent
as to the upbringing of the child and his associates in the
formative period of childhood and adolescence.” If public
education is to have the support of the people through their
legislatures, Judge Parker said, “it must not go contrary
to what they deem for the best interests of their children.”
The plaintiffs’ expert witnesses had testified that mixed
schools would benefit children of both races by exposing
them to democratic opportunities in community living. Defense
witnesses, on the other hand, had testified that mixed
schools would result in friction and tension. Said the court:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">The questions thus presented are not questions of constitutional
right but of legislative policy, which must be
formulated, not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</i> or with doctrinaire disregard of
existing conditions, but in realistic approach to the situations
to which it is to be applied.... The Federal courts
would be going far outside their constitutional function
were they to attempt to prescribe educational policies for
the States in such matters, however desirable such policies
might be in the opinion of some sociologists or educators.
For the Federal courts to do so would result, not only in
interference with local affairs by an agency of the Federal
government, but also in the substitution of the judicial
for the legislative process in what is essentially a legislative
matter.</p>

<p>The public schools are facilities provided and paid for
by the States. The State’s regulation of the facilities which
it furnishes is not to be interfered with unless constitutional
rights are clearly infringed. There is nothing in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Constitution that requires that a State grant to all members
of the public a common right to use every facility
that it affords.... The equal protection of the laws does
not mean that the child must be treated as the property
of the State and the wishes of his family as to his upbringing
be disregarded.</p>
</div>

<p>In oral argument of the case, Thurgood Marshall had
urged the trial court to create judicial history by abandoning,
on its own motion, the precedents of many years in support
of “separate but equal.” Judges Parker and Timmerman were
not willing to do so. These unreversed decisions, they said,
were squarely in point and conclusive. If this long line of
cases were to be overturned or held outmoded, the Supreme
Court itself would have to take that step. And Parker
concluded:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To this we may add that, when seventeen States and
the Congress of the United States have for more than
three-quarters of a century required segregation of the
races in the public schools, and when this has received
the approval of the leading appellate courts of the country
including the unanimous approval of the Supreme
Court of the United States at a time when that Court included
Chief Justice Taft and Justices Stone, Holmes and
Brandeis, it is a late day to say that such segregation is
violative of fundamental constitutional rights. It is hardly
reasonable to suppose that legislative bodies over so wide
a territory, including the Congress of the United States,
and great judges of high courts have knowingly defied
the Constitution for so long a period or that they have
acted in ignorance of the meaning of its provisions. The
constitutional principle is the same now that it has been
throughout this period; and if conditions have changed
so that segregation is no longer wise, this is a matter for
the legislatures and not for the courts. <em>The members of
the judiciary have no more right to read their ideas of
sociology into the Constitution than their ideas of economics.</em>
[Emphasis supplied.]</p>
</div>

<p>In the course of time, to be sure, the Warren court was
to do precisely what Judge Parker said judges ought never
to do, but nearly three years were to elapse before that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
famous decree would descend upon the South. Meanwhile,
the other three cases, in Kansas, Virginia, and Delaware,
were still to be tried. They followed the Clarendon pattern
rather closely. In Topeka, counsel for the Negro plaintiffs
made little effort to show physical inequalities in the city’s
white and Negro schools. The city was then operating
eighteen white schools and four Negro schools, under a
State law permitting, but not compelling, racial separation.
The trial court found as a fact (98 F. Supp. 797) that the
facilities were substantially equal: “It is obvious that absolute
equality of physical facilities is impossible of attainment.”
The broader question presented by the plaintiffs
“poses a question not free from difficulty,” but Judge Walter
A. Huxman and his colleagues in Kansas was no more disposed
than Judge Parker and Judge Timmerman in South
Carolina to upset long-established precedents. The three-judge
court unanimously upheld segregation in the Topeka
schools.</p>

<p>In Virginia, the Prince Edward County case was tried
February 25-29, 1952, before a court composed of Circuit
Judge Armistead Dobie and District Judges Sterling Hutcheson
and Albert Bryan. Once again, as in South Carolina, the
defense confessed the physical inequality of white and Negro
school facilities, and accepted a court order requiring prompt
and diligent efforts to make the facilities equal. But here, too,
physical equality was not the principal issue. The question
was whether segregation in itself violated the Fourteenth
Amendment. On this point, the Negro plaintiffs produced a
fresh array of sociologists, anthropologists, psychologists, and
psychiatrists to testify to the harmful effects of segregation;
the defense produced “equally distinguished and qualified
educationists and leaders in other fields” who emphatically
asserted that, given equivalent physical facilities, offerings,
and instruction, the Negro would receive in a separate school
the same educational opportunity he would obtain in a mixed
school. Each of the expert witnesses, said Judge Bryan,
“offered cogent and appealing grounds for his conclusion.”</p>

<p>But the three Federal jurists in Virginia took the same
position that Parker and Timmerman had taken in Clarendon
County&mdash;in brief, that the only duty of a Federal court in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
such a case is to determine whether a State’s policy is so
arbitrary and capricious as to be wholly without support in
reason. Here, the “unbroken usage in Virginia for more than
eighty years” offered evidence of a policy reflecting the established
mores of the people. So distinguished a witness as
Virginia’s Colgate W. Darden, a former Governor and then
president of the University of Virginia, had testified that elimination
of separate schools would injure both races. Under
the circumstances, the court was unable to say that the State’s
policy of racially separate schools was without substance in
fact or reason:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">We have found no hurt or harm to either race. This ends
our inquiry. It is not for us to adjudge the policy as right
or wrong&mdash;that the Commonwealth of Virginia shall determine
for itself.</p>
</div>

<p>Last of the four cases to be heard was in Delaware, where
the State Chancellor on April 1, 1952, entered an order
directing the admission of a number of Negro children to
the public schools of New Castle County on a nondiscriminatory
basis (87 A.2d 862). The evidence was not in
dispute: The colored high school students were denied admission
to Claymont High School and were required instead
to attend Howard High School in neighboring Wilmington.
Elementary pupils were barred from Hockessin School No.
29 and required instead to attend the all-Negro Hockessin
School No. 107. The Chancellor found that inequalities did
in fact exist, in teacher training, pupil-teacher ratio, extracurricular
activities, transportation, physical plant, and the
like. Though he was inclined to agree that segregation in
itself “results in Negro children, as a class, receiving educational
opportunities which are substantially inferior to those
available to white children,” the Chancellor was unwilling to
decide the case on this new ground. On the merits of their
case alone, under the separate-but-equal rule, the Negro plaintiffs
were entitled to immediate relief. On August 28, 1952,
the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed (91 A. [2d] 127).
And the Supreme Court of the United States, having granted
certiorari in each of the cases, set them for joint argument
December 9-11, 1952.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The Supreme Court of the United States then was headed
by Fred M. Vinson of Kentucky, as Chief Justice. Others
who heard the ten hours of argument that December were
Hugo L. Black of Alabama, Felix Frankfurter of Massachusetts,
William O. Douglas of Connecticut, Robert H. Jackson
of New York, Harold H. Burton of Ohio, Tom C. Clark of
Texas, Sherman Minton of Indiana, and Stanley Reed of
Kentucky.</p>

<p>It is difficult&mdash;impossible might be a better word&mdash;to guess
at the outcome of a Supreme Court case by attempting to
read the minds of the judges through the questions asked
from the bench. Here, however, it seemed unusually clear
that the court was seriously divided. Burton indicated the
course that ultimately was to be taken. During argument on
the Topeka case, he put a question to Paul E. Wilson, assistant
attorney general of Kansas: “Don’t you recognize it as
possible that in seventy-five years the social and economic
conditions of the Nation have changed so that which might
have been a valid interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment
seventy-five years ago would not be valid today?” Wilson
replied that he recognized the possibility, but did not
believe the record disclosed such a change. Evidently recalling
some of Judge Parker’s language in the Clarendon County
decision, Burton persisted: “But that might be different from
saying that these courts of appeals and State supreme courts
have been wrong for seventy-five years?” Wilson agreed, but
made the point that until the Supreme Court itself overturned
its own precedents, no other guide to the law was available.
When John W. Davis arose to argue the South Carolina
appeal, Burton put the same question to him. Davis said:
“My answer to that is that changed conditions may affect
policy, but changed conditions cannot broaden the terminology
of the Constitution.” Changes in social or economic
conditions, Davis thought, raised “an administrative or political
question, not a judicial one.” Burton subsided with a
remark that he viewed the Constitution as a living document
“that must be interpreted in relation to the facts of the times
in which it is interpreted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>

<p>Pointedly stating a conflicting view, Frankfurter interrupted
Thurgood Marshall’s argument at one point to recall that
the court recently had upheld the power of Louisiana to restrict
the calling of river pilots “to the question of who your
father was.” The court sustained that legislation, he said,
“not because we thought it admirable or because we believed
in primogeniture, but because it was so imbedded in the history
of that problem in Louisiana that we thought on the
whole that was an allowable justification.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the argument, attorneys on both sides
were hopeful. The Negro forces felt reasonably certain they
had Douglas, Black, and Burton; the State attorneys thought
they had impressed Jackson, Minton, Frankfurter, and probably
Clark. Vinson and Reed were question marks. It was
anticipated that a decision would be handed down by a divided
court some time in March or April.</p>

<p>Instead, time ran on until June 8, 1953, when the court,
unable to reach any decision on which a majority of the
court could agree, set the case for reargument on five questions.
Two of the questions were technical in nature: Assuming
it were decided that segregation in itself violates the Fourteenth
Amendment, how should decrees be formulated? How
should the cases be handled on remand to the lower courts?
The other three questions went to the very heart of American
constitutional law.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Question 1: What evidence is there that the Congress
which submitted and the State legislatures and conventions
which ratified the Fourteenth Amendment contemplated or
did not contemplate, understood or did not understand,
that it would abolish segregation in public schools?</em></p>
</div>

<p>The Supreme Court posed this first question, in theory
at least, for one reason only: Its object was to determine
whether the power to operate racially separate schools ever
had been prohibited to the States <em>by the Constitution</em>; for
if this power had not been prohibited to the States by the
Constitution, it was theirs to exercise respectively, for good
or ill. (It was conceded that the power never had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
prohibited to them by any law of the United States adopted
pursuant to the Constitution). Obviously, nothing in the
Constitution possibly could prohibit this power to the States
except Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This section
imposes three prohibitions on the States: (1) No State shall
make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United States; (2) nor shall
any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law; (3) nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>

<p>In point of fact, it was only the third of these prohibitions
that concerned the court. (A right to attend school in any
particular State is not a privilege of a “citizen of the United
States,” but of a citizen of the State in question; and only
by rather far-fetched reasoning could it be contended that
by placing white children in one school and Negro children
in another school, a State was depriving any person of life,
liberty, or property without due process of law. From
the beginning, the plaintiffs’ case rested in an assertion that
equal protection had been denied the Negro pupils.) How
was the court to be advised if this provision of the Fourteenth
Amendment prohibited to the States the power to
operate racially separate schools? Only one procedure is
known to the law; it is the procedure used by the Supreme
Court and by other courts from the very beginning of the
Republic: <em>It is to determine the intent of the framers.</em> What
did the Congress and the ratifying States mean by the
Fourteenth Amendment? In terms of racially separate public
schools, what did they intend the amendment to accomplish?
What was their understanding? In construing a written
Constitution, an inquiry into intent is paramount. Cooley’s
<em>Limitations</em> states the rule in this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A cardinal rule in dealing with written instruments is
that they are to receive an unvarying interpretation, and
that their practical construction is to be uniform. A
Constitution is not to be made to mean one thing at one
time, and another at some subsequent time when the
circumstances may have so changed as perhaps to make
a different rule in the case seem desirable. A principal
share of the benefit expected from written Constitutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
would be lost if the rules they established were so flexible
as to bend to circumstances or be modified by public
opinion. It is with special reference to the varying moods
of public opinion, and with a view to putting the fundamentals
of government beyond their control, that these
instruments are framed; and there can be no such steady
and imperceptible change in their rules as inheres in the
principles of the common law. These beneficent maxims of
the common law which guard person and property have
grown and expanded until they mean vastly more to us
than they did to our ancestors, and are more minute,
particular, and pervading in their protections; and we may
confidently look forward in the future to still further
modifications in the direction of improvement. Public
sentiment and action effect such changes, and the courts
recognize them; but a court or legislature which should
allow a change in public sentiment to influence it in giving
construction to a written Constitution not warranted by
the intention of its founders, would be justly chargeable
with reckless disregard of official oath and public duty....
What a court is to do, therefore, is to declare the law as
written, leaving it to the people themselves to make such
changes as new circumstances may require. The meaning
of the Constitution is fixed when it is adopted, and it is
not different at any subsequent time when a court has
occasion to pass upon it.</p>
</div>

<p>Chief Justice Taney made the same point in the <em>Dred
Scott</em> case (19 Howard 393). It had been argued (this was
in 1857) that public attitudes had changed enormously
toward the Negro since the adoption of the Constitution
sixty-eight years earlier. But should this shift in public attitude
induce the court “to give to the words of the Constitution
a more liberal construction in their favor than they
were intended to bear when the instrument was framed and
adopted”? Taney thought such an argument “altogether inadmissible”
in any tribunal called upon to interpret the
Constitution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">If any of its provisions are deemed unjust, there is a
mode prescribed in the instrument itself by which it may
be amended; but while it remains unaltered, it must be
construed now as it was understood at the time of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
adoption. It is not only the same in words, but the same
in meaning, and delegates the same powers to the government,
and reserves and secures the same rights and
privileges to the citizen; and as long as it continues to
exist in its present form, it speaks not only in the same
words, but with the same meaning and intent with which
it spoke when it came from the hands of its framers, and
was voted on and adopted by the people of the United
States. Any other rule of construction would abrogate
the judicial character of this court, and make it the mere
reflex of the popular opinion or passion of the day.
This court was not created by the Constitution for such
purposes.</p>
</div>

<p>Many other authorities, over a span of generations, have
said substantially the same thing about the necessity of
courts’ holding steadfastly to the demonstrable intention of
a constitutional provision. “The ultimate touchstone of constitutionality,”
Frankfurter once asserted, “is the Constitution
itself and not what we have said about it” (306 U. S. 491).
Hughes urged his colleagues not to be swayed by arguments
that extraordinary events may justify abandonment of the
rule: “Extraordinary conditions do not create or enlarge
constitutional power” (245 U. S. 495). Douglas, dissenting
in <em>New York</em> v. <em>the United States</em> (326 U. S. 572), sternly
lectured his brothers on their obligations in this regard; when
a constitutional rule is to be fashioned that undermines the
long-understood sovereignty of the States, he said, it ought
never to be done by judicial construction: “Any such
change should be accomplished only by constitutional amendment.”</p>

<p>This solid principle of constitutional law was in the court’s
mind that day in June 1953 when it asked for reargument
in the School Segregation Cases. What happened to the
principle thereafter is sadly apparent: The court tossed it
summarily to one side. But briefly, at least, the court recognized
that in constitutional cases, clocks must always be
turned back.</p>

<p>The NAACP, on behalf of the Negro plaintiffs, did its
dead-level best to come up with some history to support its
case. The story of the plaintiffs’ exertions was confessed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
December 28, 1961, by Professor Alfred H. Kelly, of Wayne
State University in Detroit, in an address before the annual
meeting of the American Historical Association in Washington.
Excerpts from his address were reprinted in the <cite>U. S.
News &amp; World Report</cite> of February 5, 1962. They provide
a fascinating, and a sobering, revelation of what Negrophile
zeal can do to an honest man.</p>

<p>“One day in early July, 1953,” Professor Kelly began,
“I received a letter from Mr. Thurgood Marshall.”</p>

<p>Marshall wanted Professor Kelly to prepare a research
paper that would support the NAACP’s answer to the first
question posed by the court. At stake was the venerable
“separate but equal” rule, to which Professor Kelly, as a
person, was deeply opposed. Marshall explained that the
rule was crumbling and about to fall; but if the rule were
to be overthrown after all these years, “it would entail a
piece of judicial lawmaking which could be justified only
by a philosophy of extreme judicial activism&mdash;and this at
the hands of a Court wherein several expressed their disapproval
of judicial activism and lawmaking by Court-made
fiat.” But if this revolution in the legal status of the Negro
were to be achieved, the attempt had to be made&mdash;and
Dr. Kelly was ready to help make it. After all, both the
lawyers and the scholars at work on the case agreed that
the old rule had to be disposed of&mdash;but how? Dr. Kelly
paraphrased their dilemma:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We would like to dispose of the Plessy rule, for once
and for all....</p>

<p>But we are fearfully embarrassed by the apparent
historical absurdity of such an interpretation of the
Fourteenth Amendment and equally embarrassed by the
obvious charge that the Court will be “legislating” if it
simply imposes a new meaning on the Amendment without
regard to historical intent.</p>
</div>

<p>How to escape from this embarrassment? Why, historians
must produce for the NAACP a plausible historical argument
to justify the court in pronouncing (a) that the intent
of the Fourteenth Amendment in this regard was unclear,
or (b) that the amendment really had been intended, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
along, to abolish school segregation, or at least to sanction
its abolition by judicial fiat.</p>

<p>So Dr. Kelly went to work. As a constitutional historian,
he acknowledged what the South’s attorneys were to contend,
that the Fourteenth Amendment was the direct outgrowth
of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. He did what a
Southern lawyer or anyone else would do under the circumstances:
He went to the <cite>Congressional Globe</cite> for the
first session of the Thirty-ninth Congress of 1866 and read
the debates himself. To his intense dismay, he found the
<cite>Globe</cite> “had a good deal to say about school segregation.”
And at first blush, “most of what appeared there looked
rather decidedly bad....” Indeed, it looked as if John W.
Davis, arguing the case for the South Carolina defendants,
“would win the historical argument hands down!”</p>

<p>But Dr. Kelly spat on his hands and went to work. In
the course of time, by his own candid and tortured admission,
“I ceased to function as a historian, and, instead, took
up the practice of law without a license.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The problem we faced was not the historian’s discovery
of truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; the
problem instead was the formulation of an adequate gloss
on the fateful events of 1866 sufficient to convince the
Court that we had something of an historical case....</p>

<p>It is not that we were engaged in formulating lies; there
was nothing as crude and naive as that. But we were using
facts, emphasizing facts, bearing down on facts, sliding off
facts, quietly ignoring facts and, above all, interpreting
facts in a way to do what Marshall said we had to do&mdash;“get
by those boys down there.”</p>
</div>

<p>Charitably, a curtain may be drawn over the agonizing
sessions that Dr. Kelly and his associates, sincerely wedded to
a social and legal cause, spent in pacing up and down a
suite in the NAACP’s headquarters on West 40th Street in
New York, dictating and arguing and glossing over, “hammering
out a strategy” that would contain some essential
measure of historical truth, but yet ... but yet....</p>

<p>They produced a 235-page brief. It must stand as a pathetic
monument to what happens when historians cease to be historians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
and take up the unlicensed practice of law. The conclusions
there drawn, that the “proponents of absolute equalitarianism
emerged victorious in the Civil War and controlled
the Congress that wrote the Fourteenth Amendment,” are a
bitter travesty upon the actual course of events. For it is
plain to any objective student&mdash;to any man who will stand
still long enough to ask and receive an answer to the elementary
question, <em>What happened?</em>&mdash;that no such thing occurred.
The visible, palpable, unrelenting, unavoidable truth is that
Sumner and Stevens and their fellow radicals did not control
the Congress in 1866; they did <em>not</em> get what they wanted in
the Fourteenth Amendment; they got half a loaf at most:
And the proof of the pudding may be found where it always
lies, in what happened after the amendment was adopted.</p>

<p>The answer to the court’s first question is perfectly clear:
<em>Of course</em> the Congress that submitted the Fourteenth Amendment,
and the States that ratified it, did not contemplate or
understand that the amendment prohibited to the States the
power to maintain segregation in the public schools. If they
had contemplated or understood this, they would have abolished
such segregation where it existed and shunned it in the
schools thereafter. In the simple, homely, undeniable fact
that such segregation was not abolished but rather was widely
continued lies a complete answer to the court’s question. It
should have been a complete answer to the whole case.</p>

<p>Evidence to support this view may be adduced overwhelmingly
from three principal sources: (1) Actions of the Congress
itself; (2) actions of the State legislatures and constitutional
conventions; and (3) decisions of State and Federal
courts in the period immediately following adoption of the
amendment.</p>


<p class="p1"><em>1. Actions of the Congress itself.</em> The Thirteenth Amendment
to the Constitution, prohibiting slavery within the
United States, or in any place subject to their jurisdiction,
was proposed by the Congress on January 31, 1865, two
months before Lee’s surrender at Appomattox was to end the
War for Southern Independence. Northern States promptly
set the ratification process in motion, and with a cessation of
hostilities in April, Southern States came along. During the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
first week of December 1865, barely ten months after the
Thirteenth Amendment had been proposed, the assents of
Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia brought the number
of ratifications to twenty-seven&mdash;three-fourths of the thirty-six
States regarded as then “in the Union” for constitutional
purposes. On December 18, 1865, Secretary Seward declared
the Thirteenth Amendment a part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>The Southern States that had been counted as never having
left the Union, for purposes of ratifying the Thirteenth
Amendment, soon discovered that for other purposes they
were still out of the Union. They were denied what the Constitution
promises every State&mdash;representation in the Congress
by at least one member of the House and two members of
the Senate&mdash;and they were permitted no hand in framing the
second Reconstruction amendment that was to be submitted
the following year. This task became the responsibility of a
joint committee of six Senators and nine Congressmen, created
in December at the request of Thaddeus Stevens.</p>

<p>During January and February 1866, while the committee
was at work in executive sessions, the House and Senate
completed action on the First Supplemental Freedmen’s Bureau
Bill. The act is important in tracing the meaning of the
Fourteenth Amendment, for it explicitly defined the principal
civil rights and immunities that were to be under constant
discussion in the Congress for the next several months. This
law guaranteed to the newly freed Negroes in the Southern
States “the right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be
parties, and give evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell,
hold and convey real and personal property; and to have full
and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security
of person and estate.”</p>

<p>The Freedmen’s Bill applied, by its own terms, only to
the late Confederacy. Simultaneously, a legislative effort was
launched to secure these same civil rights in the country as
a whole. On February 2, after bitter debate on its constitutionality,
what was to become the Civil Rights Act of
1866 passed the Senate. It went to the House, and in early
March was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee.
During floor debate on March 13, Congressman Wilson of
Iowa, chairman of the committee in charge of the bill, addressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
himself to the bill’s opening provision, declaring that
“there shall be no discrimination in the civil rights or immunities
among the inhabitants of any State or Territory
of the United States on account of race, color, or previous
condition of slavery.” This part of the bill, Wilson said,
“will probably excite more opposition than any other.” He
undertook to allay apprehensions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">What do these terms mean? Do they mean that in all things
civil, social, political, all citizens, without distinction of
race or color, shall be equal? By no means can they be so
construed.... <em>Nor do they mean that ... their children
shall attend the same schools. These are not civil rights
or immunities.</em> [Emphasis added.]</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Civil Rights Bill passed the House by 111-38 on March
13; it was vetoed on March 27, and passed over the veto
on April 9.</p>

<p>These dates are important. Late in February 1866, the
Stevens Committee had brought into the House one draft
of a proposed Fourteenth Amendment. It had been debated,
and then sent back for more work. On April 21, a new
draft came before the committee. On April 25, amendments
were approved in committee that put the amendment in the
form in which it finally was to become part of the Constitution.
These changes wrote into Section 1 new prohibitions
upon the powers of the States: “No State shall make
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any
State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without
due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.”</p>

<p>When the proposed constitutional amendment reached the
floor of the House on May 8, both its friends and its foes
reached remarkable agreement on the amendment’s primary
purpose: to nail into the Constitution the Civil Rights Act
of 1866 that on April 9 had been passed over the President’s
veto. Stevens reminded his radical colleagues that a mere
law always was subject to repeal by a majority of the House
and Senate: “And I need hardly say that the first time that
the South with their copperhead allies obtain the command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
of Congress it will be repealed.” An opponent of the resolution,
Rogers of New Jersey, said the Stevens measure “is
no more than an attempt to embody in the Constitution of
the United States that outrageous and miserable civil rights
bill....”</p>

<p>On the Senate side, when the resolution came there for
debate on May 23, the same view was taken. Howard of
Michigan, in charge of the paper, said the object was “to
put this question of citizenship and the rights of citizens and
freedmen under the civil rights bill beyond the legislative
power.” Davis of Kentucky and Henderson of Missouri
agreed. On June 8, the Senate voted in favor of the resolution,
33-11, with five Senators not voting; and on June 13
the House, which then had 184 members, completed action
by concurring in the Senate amendments, 120-32, with 32
not voting. The House margin was four votes short of the
two-thirds required under the Constitution for submitting
an amendment, but the resolution was declared to be passed
anyhow.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, other matters of course
were coming before the Congress. One such matter was a
bill passed in the Senate on May 21, providing for segregated
schools in the District of Columbia. A companion bill,
introduced in April, adopted in May, made effective in July,
appropriated funds to the Negroes’ segregated schools. And
year after year, from that time on until 1954, the Congress
continued to provide for racially separate schools in the
District of Columbia.</p>

<p>Not one iota of evidence can be adduced from the annals
of Congress in 1866 to show that any responsible member
of the House or Senate believed the Fourteenth Amendment
in any fashion would affect the operation of segregated
schools in the States. All that Negro counsel could produce
in their reargument on the point in 1953, despite the desperate
labors of Dr. Kelly and his associates, were some
generalities, some sweeping statements of ideals, and other
nebulous expressions on the part of radical abolitionists on
the one hand and apprehensive States’ Righters on the other.
It is plain that the Stevens-Sumner group won from the
Thirty-ninth Congress two compromise instruments, a statute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
and a constitutional amendment, both intended to guarantee
to the Negro the essential civil rights spelled out in the
Freedmen’s Bill and in the Civil Rights Act&mdash;to sue and be
sued, to own and inherit property, and the like. “The right to
go to school,” as Senator Trumbull of Pennsylvania was to
say in 1872 in debating the General Amnesty Act, “is not
a civil right and never was.”</p>


<p class="p1"><em>2. Actions of the State legislatures and constitutional conventions.</em>
The proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
went out to the States on June 18, 1866. Connecticut
ratified on June 30, New Hampshire on July 6, Tennessee on
July 19. New Jersey and Oregon, both of whom later were to
rescind their actions, ratified in September. Then came a jolt:
On October 27, Texas flatly rejected the proposed amendment,
by a vote of 70 to 5 in the House and 27 to 1 in the
Texas Senate. Vermont ratified on October 30, but on November
1 Georgia rejected by 147-2 and 38-0 in its House
and Senate. Then, in rapid succession, Arkansas, Florida,
North Carolina, and South Carolina spurned the amendment.
In January 1867, Virginia, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Maryland
rejected. Early in February, Delaware and Louisiana
turned it down also.</p>

<p>On March 2, 1867, an infuriated Congress enacted over
Johnson’s veto a law that seems incredible by any standpoint
of constitutional law. This “Act to Provide for the More
Efficient Government of the Rebel States” further defined
the districts that had been created in the former Confederacy
by earlier Reconstruction acts. Section 5 of the Act fixed
two requirements for readmission of the Southern States to
full standing in the Union. The first condition was that each
of the States adopt a new State Constitution; the second was
that, at the first legislature to be held after adoption of the
new Constitution, each State must ratify the Fourteenth
Amendment. Delegates to the State constitutional conventions
were to be chosen by all male citizens regardless of
race, except felons and those who had participated in the
“rebellion.” No Confederate veteran who earlier had been a
member of a State legislature, or held any other office under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
the government of a Southern State, could become a candidate
for the new legislatures to be elected.</p>

<p>With that vindictive and extortionate act, military government
settled upon the South and all semblance of free republican
government vanished. With no alternative but to submit
or remain under the sword, the Southern States accepted the
amendment. Arkansas ratified in April 1868, Florida on June
9, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Louisiana
in July. Meanwhile, Ohio on January 13, 1868, had undertaken
to rescind its ratification of the amendment, and New
Jersey, on March 25, had done the same thing. In both
States, recently the bitter foes of the South, the new amendment
was denounced as unconstitutionally approved in the
House of Representatives and unconstitutionally demanded
of the Southern States. (It was several months later, in
October 1868, that Oregon also attempted to rescind its
ratification.)</p>

<p>On July 20, 1868, Secretary Seward issued a cautious proclamation
certifying that the Fourteenth Amendment had been
ratified. There were, he surmised, thirty-seven States then
“in the Union.” Twenty-eight, by Seward’s count, had approved
the amendment, but he was doubtful about the whole
affair. Among his twenty-eight were Arkansas, Florida, North
Carolina, Louisiana, and South Carolina, where ratification
had been sanctioned by “newly constituted and newly established
bodies avowing themselves to be acting as the legislatures”
of these States. If their resolutions were valid, and
if the original ratifications of Ohio and New Jersey were
still valid, notwithstanding their subsequent withdrawals, the
amendment was a part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>On the following day, July 21, Congress passed a joint
resolution to resolve Seward’s doubts. It ordered him to declare
the amendment unconditionally adopted; and on July
28, adding the names of Alabama and Georgia, whose notifications
had just been received, Seward declared the Fourteenth
officially a part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Was the Fourteenth Amendment thus legally and constitutionally
added to the Constitution in 1868? It is exceedingly
doubtful. Neither a resolution of the Congress nor a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
proclamation of a Secretary of State can supersede the Constitution
itself. If the States of Arkansas, Florida, North
Carolina, Alabama, South Carolina, and Louisiana were “in
the Union” in 1865, when their ratifications of the Thirteenth
Amendment were counted among the three-fourths necessary
to adoption, it is impossible to understand how they legally
could have been read out of the Union by the act of March
2, 1867, put under military dictatorship, and ordered to ratify
the Fourteenth Amendment under duress. If the Confederate
States are eliminated from the equation altogether, a mathematical
case can be made to support ratification. Twenty-five
States were represented in the Thirty-ninth Congress that
proposed the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866. Nebraska was
admitted to the Union March 1, 1867. Three-fourths of
twenty-six States (for ratification purposes) is twenty States.
By the time of the proclamations and resolutions of July
1868, twenty-one States outside the South had unconditionally
ratified the amendment. But the assumption on which
the Congress proceeded was that there were thirty-seven
States in the Union in the summer of 1868. Three-fourths
of thirty-seven States (for ratification purposes) is twenty-eight
States. In order to count twenty-eight States, the ratifications
of the rescinding New Jersey and Ohio must be added
to those of Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana,
and South Carolina; or, in place of New Jersey and Ohio,
the ratifications of Alabama and Georgia may be substituted.
In any event, reliance must be placed upon the coerced ratifications
of either five or seven Southern States which at that
time were denied a republican government, denied representation
in the Congress, and denied the right to act freely
upon the proposed amendment. This is the tainted parenthood
of the constitutional provision on which the Supreme
Court of the United States, in the school cases, sought to be
informed.</p>

<p>I digress. The question here is, “What evidence is there
that the ... State legislatures and conventions which ratified
the Fourteenth Amendment contemplated or did not contemplate,
understood or did not understand, that it would abolish
segregation in public schools?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p>This is the evidence:</p>

<p>Among the States that ratified the Fourteenth Amendment
were these twelve: Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon,
Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. There is not a scrap
of evidence to suggest that the issue of school segregation
ever was considered in any of them. Rhode Island, Connecticut,
and Michigan were the only States in this group with as
much as 2 per cent Negro population in 1870 (Rhode Island
had 5000 Negroes out of 217,000; Connecticut had 9668
Negroes in a population of 537,000; Michigan a Negro population
of 11,849 in a total of 1,184,000.) The rest ranged
down to the 346 Negroes then resident in Oregon and the
789 then resident in Nebraska. School segregation simply was
no problem in these States in 1866. The question never was
discussed.</p>

<p>Two other States that ratified the Fourteenth Amendment
were Florida and Louisiana. Both houses of Florida’s legislature,
when they were in a position to act freely, rejected the
amendment unanimously. This was in December 1866. The
following March came the Reconstruction Act, and in the
course of time came a State constitutional convention set up
by military decree. It was comprised of eighteen Negroes and
twenty-seven Carpetbaggers and Scalawags. On June 9, 1868,
the Governor of Florida dispatched to a similarly chosen
legislature a message recommending “that no action be taken
save that dictated by the acts of Congress as conditions precedent
to admission, to wit: The passage of the proposed
amendment to the Constitution, known as the Fourteenth
Article....” The Florida legislature submissively ratified the
amendment, 23-6 in the House, 10-3 in the Senate. Public
schools were set up, with no statutory or constitutional provision
to prevent their joint use by both races; but the evidence
is persuasive that no integration ever occurred in this
period, and in 1885, when an end to Reconstruction permitted
Florida to follow the separate-but-equal pattern which
by then had been solidly established elsewhere, the Florida
Constitution was amended to provide that “white and colored
children shall not be taught in the same school, but impartial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
provision shall be made for both.” Certainly Florida did not
understand that the amendment, of and by itself, prohibited
the States from requiring racial separation in the schools.</p>

<p>The situation in Louisiana was more chaotic still. The
Louisiana legislature unanimously rejected the amendment in
February 1867. Reconstruction followed. A constitutional
convention was created, composed of forty-nine Negroes and
forty-nine Carpetbaggers and Scalawags; it wrote a provision
into the Louisiana Constitution that “all children ... shall be
admitted to the public schools in common, without distinction
of race, color, or previous condition. There shall be no
separate schools or institutions of learning established exclusively
for any race by the State of Louisiana.” But this
language in a coerced State Constitution was ignored by the
people. In 1870, the Superintendent of Public Instruction was
to complain that the constitutional provision “excites a determined
opposition on the part of many who would otherwise
cooperate in the opening of schools and in the raising
of funds for their support.” As the years passed, Louisiana
established a system of racially separate public schools, in
accordance with the demonstrable understanding of the Fourteenth
Amendment elsewhere in the Union, and a freely
chosen constitutional convention in 1898 made segregation
mandatory.</p>

<p>Florida and Louisiana have been here singled out, because
the confused record in the two States offers the best opportunity&mdash;indeed,
the only opportunity&mdash;for a case to be made
that <em>any</em> of the States ever understood or contemplated that
the Fourteenth Amendment might in any fashion serve to
prohibit the operation of racially separate schools. If evidence
cannot be adduced here, it cannot be adduced anywhere.
And this poor, scanty record of actions taken under duress&mdash;and
later repudiated under freedom&mdash;is the best that hard-laboring
historians can produce.</p>

<p>What of the other States? In twenty-three other States, positive
evidence is available that neither the State conventions
nor the State legislatures at any time ever understood or contemplated
that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited them
from establishing racially separate schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span></p>

<p>Look at the record, <em>first in terms of States outside the
South</em>:</p>

<p><em>California</em> took no action on the Fourteenth Amendment,
but it established racially separate schools by statute in 1870,
two years after the amendment had been ratified.</p>

<p><em>Delaware</em> refused to ratify the amendment, and made no
provision for Negro education of any sort until 1881. Then
separate Negro schools were established, and Delaware’s
constitution of 1897 made segregation mandatory. How can
it be contended that Delaware understood the Fourteenth
Amendment to prohibit separate schools?</p>

<p><em>Illinois</em> refused to admit Negroes to any schools at the
time of its ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. It was
not until five years later that a general school law admitted
them to educational facilities&mdash;some segregated, others integrated.
Segregated schools persisted at least until 1884, when
the Supreme Court of Illinois acknowledged the operation of
segregated institutions, and ruled them in violation of a State
law that had been passed in the interim. But no court or
legislature in Illinois ever asserted that such schools were in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p><em>Indiana</em> ratified the Fourteenth Amendment in June 1867,
following a message from Governor Morton specifically advocating
“the establishment of separate schools,” because “I
could not recommend that white and colored children be
placed together in the same schools.” And it was not until
1949&mdash;eighty-one years after adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment&mdash;that Indiana formally abandoned segregation
in its schools.</p>

<p><em>New Jersey</em> was another Northern State in which racially
separate schools were continued long after adoption of the
Fourteenth Amendment. It was not until 1881 that the legislature
prohibited their operation, but when this statute was
construed three years later, no mention of any sort was made
of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p><em>New York.</em> What of New York? The State ratified the
Fourteenth in January 1867, and later the same year convened
a constitutional convention at which a ringing declaration
was adopted in favor of civil rights&mdash;but there was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
a word in this declaration in support of racially integrated
schools. On the contrary, separate schools were specifically
permitted in New York until 1900&mdash;thirty-two years after
the Fourteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution.
Can it be seriously contended that New York understood
or contemplated that the amendment in and of itself would
abolish school segregation?</p>

<p>To bring these Northern examples to an end, consider
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. <em>Ohio</em> had racially
separate schools at the time it ratified in 1867; such schools
specifically were continued by a statute of 1874, and the
system was not discarded by State law until 1887. <em>Pennsylvania</em>
also had a system of segregated schools at the time
of its ratification in 1867; the legislature continued the system
by statute in 1869; the system was not abolished until
1881. <em>West Virginia’s</em> legislature ratified the Fourteenth on
January 16, 1867. On February 27, precisely six weeks later,
the same legislature adopted a statute providing that “white
and colored persons shall not be taught in the same schools.”
What is one to say of West Virginia’s understanding of the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>

<p>Action of the Southern States was entirely in accord with
the understanding thus demonstrated by their recent enemies
in the North. To summarize these briefly:</p>

<p><em>Alabama</em> ratified under coercion on July 13, 1868; but
less than a month later, on August 11, 1868, the same
legislature&mdash;even though it was dominated by Negroes and
Carpetbaggers&mdash;enacted a law prohibiting mixed schools
“unless it be by the unanimous consent of the parents and
guardians of such children.”</p>

<p><em>Arkansas</em> ratified on April 6, 1868. The same military
legislature on July 23, 1868, passed a statute directing the
State Board of Education to “make the necessary provisions
for establishing separate schools for white and colored
children.”</p>

<p><em>Georgia</em> ratified twice, once in 1868 and again in 1870.
The latter legislature still was under Reconstruction rule; a
majority of both houses were Republicans. But even this
legislature, immediately after its renewed ratification of 1870,
adopted a school act providing that “the children of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
white and colored races shall not be taught together in any
sub-district of the State.”</p>

<p><em>Kentucky</em>, not subject to military reconstruction, rejected
the Fourteenth in January 1867. The same legislature provided
for racially separate schools, and the State’s constitution
of 1891 required them.</p>

<p><em>Mississippi’s</em> legislature, dominated by Republicans and
Negroes, ratified the Amendment in 1870 and simultaneously
provided for a public school system. It was a segregated
system, though the law did not require this specifically.
Segregation was made mandatory in the schools in 1878.</p>

<p><em>North Carolina</em> ratified in July 1868. The following winter
saw enactment of a statute directing local school authorities
to establish “separate schools for the instruction of children
and youth of each race.”</p>

<p><em>South Carolina’s</em> Reconstruction constitutional convention
(seventy-six Negroes, forty-eight Carpetbaggers) directed
the forthcoming State legislature to establish a public school
system free to all children “without regard to race or color,”
but the Reconstruction legislature (only twenty-two of its
155 members could read or write) paid no attention to the
provision. The Governor was a brevet brigadier general from
Maine, Robert K. Scott. In his Inaugural Address he told
the assembled illiterate Negroes and white legislators quite
frankly that he deemed racial separation in the schools “of
the greatest importance to all classes of our people.” Listen
to what this Union Governor of South Carolina said, on the
very day after the South Carolina legislature had ratified
the Fourteenth Amendment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While the moralist and philanthropist cheerfully recognizes
the fact that “God hath made of one blood all
nations of men” yet the statesman in legislating for a
political society that embraces two distinct, and in some
measure, antagonistic races, in the great body of its electors,
must, as far as the law of equal rights will permit,
take cognizance of existing prejudices among both. In
school districts, where the white children may be preponderate
in numbers, the colored children may be oppressed,
or partially excluded from the schools, while the
same result may accrue to the whites, in those districts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
where colored children are in the majority, <em>unless they shall
be separated by law as herein recommended</em>. [Emphasis
<em>supplied</em>.]</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">South Carolina’s legislature adopted Governor Scott’s recommendation.
A Massachusetts Negro became State Superintendent
of Public Instruction; and he presided over the establishment
of a system of segregated schools.</p>

<p>A reconstructed legislature in <em>Texas</em> ratified the Fourteenth
Amendment in February 1870. The same legislature provided
for public schools to be operated by trustees who
“may make any separation of the students or schools necessary
to insure success.” Segregated schools were made mandatory
in Texas by the Constitution of 1876.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>Virginia</em>. The Old Dominion’s first legislature
under the Reconstruction Constitution of 1869 ratified the
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution,
and then adjourned until the State’s representatives
were readmitted to Congress. Then the same legislature
reconvened and promptly enacted a statute providing for a
system of free schools under a requirement that “white
and colored persons shall not be taught in the same schools,
but in separate schools.”</p>

<p>What does all this add up to? Simply this: There were
thirty-seven States whose “understandings” and “contemplations”
of the Fourteenth Amendment at the time of its
ratification must be sought. In fourteen of these States
(twelve non-Southern States plus Florida and Louisiana), no
substantial evidence can be adduced one way or another.
In twenty-three of these States (fourteen non-Southern States
and nine Southern States), positive evidence exists to show
that ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment was never
thought to prohibit the operation of racially separate schools.
The very legislative bodies that ratified the amendment simultaneously
provided for separate schools. In not a single
one of the thirty-seven States is there any substantial evidence&mdash;or
even any flimsy evidence&mdash;to show affirmatively
that the legislatures that considered the Fourteenth Amendment
believed, understood, or contemplated that the amendment
in and of itself, would prohibit school segregation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<p class="p1"><em>3. Decisions of State and Federal courts in the period
immediately following adoption of the amendment.</em> Confronting
this overwhelming evidence, counsel for the Negro
plaintiffs desperately attempted to establish what might be
called a conspiracy theory, so far as the Southern States were
concerned: These States, it was suggested, knew all along
that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to prohibit
them from maintaining separate schools, but they conspired
to deceive the rest of the nation until they were formally readmitted
to the Union and Reconstruction had ended. This
theory does not justify even the contempt with which defense
counsel brushed it aside. The plain and visible fact is that
racially separate schools were everywhere recognized and
accepted as fully in compliance with the new constitutional
provisions. It is not necessary to seek evidence of this recognition
in Southern States alone, nor to rely upon the
interpretation that “politicians” may have put upon the
amendment here and there. Let us turn from Congress and
the State legislatures, and see what the courts said about
the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment in the years
immediately following its ratification in 1868.</p>

<p>The clock should be turned back first to 1849, nineteen
years before the ratification of the amendment, when Sarah
C. Roberts, a five-year-old Negro girl, brought suit against
the City of Boston (59 Mass. 198) in the Supreme Judicial
Court of Massachusetts. Boston then had two primary
schools exclusively for Negroes, one on Belknap Street, in
the Eighth School District, the other on Sun Court Street,
in the Second. Negroes made up one sixty-second of Boston’s
population, but among this one sixty-second was Sarah Roberts,
a resident of the Sixth District on Andover Street. She
wanted to attend the white school nearest her. Charles
Sumner and R. Morris, Jr., brought suit in her behalf,
contending as many others were to contend in subsequent
years that Sarah had a right to attend her neighborhood
school, and that Boston had no right to make classification
by race. The suit came on to be heard before Chief Justice
Lemuel Shaw and others. This, to repeat, was many years
prior to the Fourteenth Amendment, but the question put
to the court was to be the question argued many times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
thereafter: What are the “privileges” of the individual citizens?
Where do the powers of the state end in terms of a
racial classification for schoolchildren? This is Boston, 1849:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The great principle, advanced by the learned and
eloquent advocate of the plaintiff, is, that by the constitution
and laws of Massachusetts, all persons without distinction
of age or sex, birth or color, origin or condition,
are equal before the law. This, as a broad general principle,
such as ought to appear in a declaration of rights, is
perfectly sound; it is not only expressed in terms, but
pervades and animates the whole spirit of our constitution
of free government. But, when this great principle comes
to be applied to the actual and various conditions of
persons in society, it will not warrant the assertion that
men and women are legally clothed with the same civil
and political powers, and that children and adults are
legally to have the same functions and be subject to the
same treatment, but only that the rights of all, as they
are settled and regulated by law, are equally entitled to
the paternal consideration and protection of the law, for
their maintenance and security. What those rights are,
to which individuals, in the infinite variety of circumstances
by which they are surrounded in society, are entitled,
must depend on the laws adapted to their respective
relations and conditions.</p>

<p>Conceding, therefore, in the fullest manner, that colored
persons, the descendants of Africans, are entitled by law,
in this commonwealth, to equal rights, constitutional and
political, civil and social, the question then arises, whether
the regulation in question, which provides separate schools
for colored children, is a violation of any of these rights.</p>
</div>

<p>The Massachusetts court faced the issue squarely, and concluded
that separate schools did no violence to any civil right
or privilege held by the colored children. The court’s inquiry
was directed toward a single point: Was this a reasonable
classification? Had the school trustees abused their responsibility?
After great deliberation, the trustees had concluded
that the good of both white and colored children would be
promoted by separate primary schools. Said the court: “We
can perceive no ground to doubt that this is the honest result
of their experience and judgment.” It was urged that such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
separation tends to deepen and perpetuate the odious distinction
of caste, founded in a deep-rooted prejudice in public
opinion. Said the Massachusetts court:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">This prejudice, if it exists, is not created by law, and probably
cannot be changed by law. Whether this distinction
and prejudice, existing in the opinion and feelings of the
community, would not be as effectually fostered by compelling
colored and white children to associate together in
the same schools, may well be doubted; at all events, it
is a fair and proper question for the committee to consider
and decide upon, having in view the best interests of both
classes of children placed under their superintendence....</p>
</div>

<p>The Massachusetts court refused to say that the trustees’
decision in behalf of racially separate schools was capricious
or arbitrary; such a decision was within their realistic prerogatives,
and it denied no child his “civil rights.” The court
spoke long before the Civil War, long before there was a
Fourteenth Amendment; but the universal understanding of
the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment was that the
amendment neither created nor secured any “new” rights of
citizens of the United States&mdash;it merely defined and secured,
for the emancipated Negro, the civil rights enjoyed by white
citizens all along. Serious students of the subject may wish
to confirm this from <cite>II Am. Jur. Const. Laws</cite> (Sect. 255,
pages 987-97). The Massachusetts opinion has great weight
in establishing, as the formal expression of an abolitionist
Northern State, that “civil rights” did not include any right
to attend racially integrated schools. If this is of merely
academic importance today, the court’s opinion in <em>Roberts</em>
v. <em>Boston</em> is significant in determining what the framers and
adopters of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866 understood
the amendment to mean. They did not mean that it would
afford the Negro citizen any more identity of access to public
facilities than the Massachusetts court was willing to
agree to in 1849.</p>

<p>Now, let us leap ahead. The Fourteenth Amendment was
proposed in 1866 and declared ratified in 1868; throughout
this period, such radical abolitionists as Sumner and Seward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
were crying for a broad interpretation of the amendment.
In Ohio, during the December term of the State Supreme
Court in 1871, a suit came on to be heard from William
Garnes against John W. McCann and other members of the
school board in Franklin County. <em>This is Ohio.</em> Its Senators
Wade and Sherman cast their votes in the thirty-ninth Congress
in favor of the amendment. The State court surely was
familiar with their views. Garnes’ complaint was that under
State laws of 1853 and 1864 his three children had been
denied admission to schools in nearby Norwich; instead, his
children were required to attend a Negro school in Hilliard.
He brought suit, based entirely on the Fourteenth Amendment,
contending that the amendment prohibited Ohio from
adopting any school law that permitted or required segregation.
His was the first direct test of the intention of the
framers and adopters.</p>

<p>The Ohio court (21 Ohio State 198) gave the petitioner’s
argument scant attention. On the theory that Garnes, as a
citizen of the United States, might have been denied certain
privileges and immunities, the court observed briefly that
the amendment went only to “such privileges or immunities
as are derived from, or recognized by, the Constitution of
the United States.” Any broader construction would open a
field of limitless conjecture “and might work such limitations
of the power of the States to manage and regulate
their local institutions and affairs <em>as were never contemplated
by the Amendment</em>.” [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p>No such construction ever had been intended. The privileges
and immunities of a school system “are derived solely
from the constitution and laws of the State.” If Ohio were
to abolish all public schools, it scarcely could be claimed
that a “citizen of the United States” could compel Ohio to
re-establish them. This being so, Garnes could demand no
more than equal protection under the laws of Ohio. And
this had not been denied him. His children were assured
their “equal proportion of the school fund.” (The court’s
assertion on this score is important to establish the point
that the doctrine of “separate but equal” arose at the very
outset of litigation on school segregation.) This was all
Garnes was entitled to demand. “A classification of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
youth of the State for school purposes, upon any basis which
does not exclude either class from equal school advantages,
is no infringement of the equal rights of citizens secured
by the constitution of the State.” And the Fourteenth
Amendment, at most, affords colored citizens only an additional
guaranty of rights already secured to them by the
State Constitution.</p>

<p>In brief, the plaintiff Garnes could not validly complain
that the privileges of his children were abridged, or that
equal protection of the law had been denied them. “Equality
of rights does not involve the necessity of educating white
and colored persons in the same school, any more than it
does that of educating children of both sexes in the same
school.” And the court added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Any classification which preserves substantially equal
school advantages is not prohibited by either the State or
Federal Constitution, nor would it contravene the provisions
of either. There is, then, no ground upon which
the plaintiff can claim that his rights under the Fourteenth
Amendment have been infringed.</p>
</div>

<p>This view of the Fourteenth Amendment, stated by the
Supreme Court of Ohio in 1871, was accepted the following
year by the United States Circuit Court for the Southern
District of Ohio. In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Buntin</em> (10 Fed. 730),
Circuit Judge Baxter summarized the <em>Garnes</em> case as a holding
that segregation is “within the constitutional discretion
of the legislature, and that the separate education of the
whites and blacks ... is no wrong to either.” Said the Federal
Circuit Court in Ohio: “I concur in and adopt this
decision as a correct exposition of the Constitution.”</p>

<p>The same question twice presented in Ohio cropped up
again in 1872 in Nevada. Surely Nevada was no Southern
State, nor could the views of its State Supreme Court have
been tainted by any Confederate conspiracy. Both of Nevada’s
Senators, Nye and Stewart, had voted in 1866 in favor
of the amendment. But in <em>Stoutmeyer</em> v. <em>Duffy</em> (7 Nev. 342),
the State court found nothing whatever in the Fourteenth
Amendment to compel the admission of a seven-year-old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Negro boy to the white schools of Ormsby County. His
denial was a violation of State law, said the court, but not
of Federal law. A concurring justice thought it “utterly untenable”
that segregated schools, as such, should be held a
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>In January 1874, the same question arose in California.
It cannot be suggested seriously that the Supreme Court of
California in <em>Ward</em> v. <em>Flood</em> (48 Calif. 36) was then acting
in some joint conspiracy with the invidious Alabamans.
Young Mary Frances Ward demanded admission to the
white Broadway Grammar School in San Francisco; Principal
Noah F. Flood, acting under State law, declined. Was
his action a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment? Plainly
not, said the California court. In the mere fact that the
races are separated in the public schools “there is certainly
to be found no violation of the constitutional rights of the
one race more than of the other, and we see none of either,
for each, though separated from the other, is to be educated
upon equal terms with that other, and both at the
common public expense.”</p>

<p>Eleven months later, in November 1874, the same question
came up in Indiana. Who would regard Indiana as a
Southern State? The case was <em>Cory</em> v. <em>Carter</em> (48 Ind. 327).
Here a Negro resident of Lawrence township in Marion
County demanded admission of his grandchildren to the
nearest local schools. An act of Indiana in May 1869,
nearly a year after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment,
required their education at nearby Negro schools.
Was the State act, as the petitioner complained, in violation
of the new amendment to the Constitution? Not at all,
said the Supreme Court of Indiana. The new Fourteenth
Amendment was not intended to prohibit to the State the
power of operating separate schools for white and Negro
children. This was a question of “domestic policy,” to be
settled by State law:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">In other words, the placing of the white children of
the State in one class and the Negro children of the
State in another class and requiring these classes to be
taught separately, provision being made for their education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
in the same branches, with capable teachers, and to
the extent of their pro rata share in the school revenue,
does not amount to a denial of equal privileges to either,
or conflict with the open character of the system required
by the Constitution. The system would be equally
open to all. The tuition would be free. The privileges of
the schools would be denied to none. The white children
go to one school, or to certain of the schools in the system
of common schools. The colored children go to
another school, or to certain others of the schools in the
system of common schools.... If there be cause of
complaint, the white class has as much, if not greater
cause than the colored class, for the latter class receive
their full share of the school revenue, although none of it
may have been contributed by such class....</p>
</div>

<p>And in a telling section of its opinion, the Indiana court
went on to make the point that Congress itself had fixed
the spirit and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment by
adopting legislation requiring racially segregated schools
in the District of Columbia. The court called attention to
the dates of such legislation: July 23, 1866; July 28, 1866;
March 3, 1873. These acts of Congress were contemporaneous
with adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. It
seemed to the Indiana court unthinkable that the Congress
should have fixed some standard for the States less than
that required of the central government, and surely Congress
itself, having framed the amendment, knew what was
intended by the amendment: “This legislation of Congress
continues in force ... as a legislative construction of the
Fourteenth Amendment, and as a legislative declaration of
what was thought to be lawful, proper, and expedient under
such amendment, by the same body that proposed such
amendment to the States for their approval and ratification.”</p>

<p>Now, to maintain the chronology, consider one case
from a Southern State: <em>Arnold Bertonneau</em> v. <em>Board of
Directors of</em> [New Orleans] <em>City Schools</em> (3 Woods 177, 3
Fed. Cases 294, Case No. 1,361). This was decided by a
Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in November 1878. The
Fourteenth Amendment was then ten years old. The question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
brought by the Negro father of two boys, seven and
nine years old, was whether under the Fourteenth Amendment
they were entitled to admission to a white school three
blocks from their home on Rampart Street. A Negro school
was also conveniently available. The Reconstruction Constitution
of Louisiana then carried the provision, earlier
quoted, that no separate schools should be established for
any race under State law. But the Federal court had no
concern for the State Constitution. Its sole concern was
with the United States Constitution, and Circuit Judge William
B. Woods found no violation of it in the schools of
the Vieux Carré. Woods, incidentally, was an Ohioan; he
had been a general in the Union Army; in 1880 he was to
be named by Hayes to the U.S. Supreme Court. Here he
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">Both races are treated precisely alike. White children
and colored children are compelled to attend different
schools. That is all.... Any classification which preserves
substantially equal school advantage does not impair
any rights, and is not prohibited by the Constitution
of the United States. Equality of right does not necessarily
imply identity of right.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most frequently quoted court cases of this
period arose in New York in 1883 (<em>People, ex. rel. King</em> v.
<em>Gallagher</em>, 93 N. Y. 438). It involved a mandamus petition
brought by a twelve-year-old Negro girl in Brooklyn to
compel a local school principal, Gallagher, to admit her to
his school despite a State law of 1864 permitting Brooklyn
to maintain racially separate schools. Her suit was based
squarely upon the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of
Appeals of New York wrote a long and serious opinion in
dismissing her petition as groundless. The history of the
amendment, said the court, “is familiar to all.” (The statement
bears special emphasis: One of New York’s Senators
at the time of the court’s opinion was Roscoe Conkling, a
leading lawyer and abolitionist who had been tendered the
office of Chief Justice. New York’s two Senators at the time
the amendment was submitted in 1866, Harris and Morgan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
both had supported the resolution. When the court said the
history of the Fourteenth was “familiar to all,” it doubtless
had in mind the opinions and interpretations of the State’s
own Senators.) In the view of the court, the object of the
amendment was to secure for the Negro people civil rights
equal to those enjoyed by white persons. But the Negroes
were not to have any greater or more extensive civil rights
than others. As citizens of the United States, their “privileges
and immunities” were to be identically protected. As
citizens of the individual States, they were to have whatever
equal State rights might be defined in those States&mdash;and
the privilege of receiving an education at the expense of
the State, being created and conferred solely by the law of
the State and subject to its discretionary regulation, was a
privilege plainly within the regulation of the State. So far
as “privileges and immunities” were concerned, the plaintiff
had nothing to complain about. But the court went on to
add some thoughtful comments on the general subject of
equal protection, and these merit a careful reading.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But we are of the opinion that our decision can also
be sustained upon another ground, and one which will be
equally satisfactory as affording a practical solution of
the questions involved. It is believed that this provision
will be given its full scope and effect when it is so construed
as to secure to all citizens, wherever domiciled,
equal protection under the laws and the enjoyment of
those privileges which belong, as of right, to each individual
citizen. This right, as affected by the questions in
this case in its fullest sense, is the privilege of obtaining
an education under the same advantages and with equal
facilities for its acquisition with those enjoyed by any
other individual. It is not believed that these provisions
were intended to regulate or interfere with the social
standing or privileges of the citizen, or to have any other
effect than to give to all, without respect to color, age or
sex, the same legal rights and the uniform protection of
the same laws.</p>

<p>In the nature of things there must be many social
distinctions and privileges remaining unregulated by law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
and left within the control of the individual citizens, as
being beyond the reach of the legislative functions of
government to organize or control. The attempt to enforce
social intimacy and intercourse between the races, by legal
enactments, would probably tend only to embitter them,
and produce an evil instead of a good result. [Citing
<em>Roberts</em> v. <em>City of Boston</em>.]</p>

<p>As to whether such intercourse shall ever occur must
eventually depend upon the operation of natural laws
and the merits of individuals, and can exist and be enjoyed
only by the voluntary consent of the persons between
whom such relations may arise, but this end can
neither be accomplished nor promoted by laws which
conflict with the general sentiment of the community
upon whom they are designed to operate. When the
government, therefore, has secured to each of its citizens
equal rights before the law and equal opportunities
for improvement and progress, it has accomplished the
end for which it is organized and performed all of the
functions respecting social advantages with which it is
endowed.</p>
</div>

<p>The New York court went on to analyze the “startling
results” that would follow from the assertion that racial separation
was intended to be prohibited by the Fourteenth
Amendment. The same line of argument would prohibit
classifications by sex or age, and surely this was not intended.
No. Plainly, said the court, the Brooklyn school
authorities had the power, “in the best interests of education,
to cause different races and nationalities, whose requirements
are manifestly different, to be educated in separate
places.” The court added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">We cannot see why the establishment of separate institutions
for the education and benefit of different races
should be held any more to imply the inferiority of one
race than that of the other, and no ground for such an
implication exists in the act of discrimination itself. If
it could be shown that the accommodations afforded to
one race were inferior to those enjoyed by another, some
advance might be made in the argument, but until that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
is established, no basis is laid for a claim that the privileges
of the respective races are not equal....</p>

<p>A natural distinction exists between those races which
was not created, neither can it be abrogated, by law,
and legislation which recognizes this distinction and provides
for the peculiar wants or conditions of the particular
race can in no just sense be called a discrimination
against such race or an abridgment of its civil rights. The
implication that the Congress of 1866, and the New York
State legislature of the same year, sitting during the
very throes of our civil war, who were respectively the
authors of legislation providing for the separate education
of the two races, were thereby guilty of unfriendly
discrimination against the colored race, will be received
with surprise by most people and with conviction by
none....</p>
</div>

<p>And the New York court went on to make the same
point earlier made in Indiana, that “the highest authority
for the interpretation of this amendment is afforded by the
action of those sessions of Congress which not only immediately
preceded, but were also contemporaneous with, the
adoption of the amendment in question.” If Congress could
establish schools exclusively for Negroes, as it repeatedly
had done, no good reason could be suggested why a greater
restriction should apply to the States. “If regard be had to
that established rule for the construction of statutes and
constitutional enactments which require courts, in giving
them effect, to regard the intent of the law-making power,
it is difficult to see why the considerations suggested are
not controlling upon the question under discussion.”</p>

<p>That was New York speaking, only fifteen years after
ratification of the amendment, in 1883. Did <em>King</em> v. <em>Gallagher</em>
say nothing at all, in 1954, to the Supreme Court of
the United States? Was this opinion not directly responsive
to the court’s question of whether the States understood or
contemplated that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended
to prohibit separate schools?</p>

<p>To complete the record of school decisions directly in
point, prior to the Supreme Court’s opinion of 1896 in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
<em>Plessy</em> v. <em>Ferguson</em>, one final case should be mentioned. This
was <em>Lehew</em> v. <em>Brummell</em> (15 S.W. 765), decided by the
Supreme Court of Missouri in March 1891. Both the Missouri
Constitution and a State act of 1887 then required
racially separate schools. Five Negro children of Grundy
County attacked the requirement as violative of both the
“privileges and immunities” and “equal protection” provisions
of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Missouri court
rejected both contentions. “The right of children to attend
the public schools, and of parents to send their children
to them, is not a privilege or immunity belonging to a citizen
of the United States as such. It is a right created by
the State, and a right belonging to citizens of the State as
such.” On the second point, separation of pupils by race
was not an unreasonable or arbitrary classification, for</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">color carries with it natural race peculiarities, which
furnish the reason for the classification. There are differences
in races, and between individuals of the same
race, not created by human laws, some of which can
never be eradicated. These differences create different
social relations, recognized by all well-ordered governments.
If we cast aside chimerical theories and look to
practical results, it seems to us it must be conceded that
separate schools for colored children is a regulation to
their great advantage.... The fact that the two races
are separated for the purpose of receiving instruction
deprives neither of any rights. It is a reasonable regulation
of the exercise of the right.</p>
</div>

<p>Mention of the <em>Lehew</em> case in Missouri brings this chronology
of judicial pronouncements on racially separate
schools to the Supreme Court’s famous statement in <em>Plessy</em>.
With that landmark in sight, the citizen seeking to learn
what the framers intended the Fourteenth Amendment to
accomplish should pause to read two other monumental
Supreme Court opinions&mdash;the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em> of
1873 (16 Wallace 36) and the <em>Civil Rights Cases</em> of 1883
(109 U. S. 3). They do not deal directly with a State’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
power to operate racially separate public schools, but they
do speak eloquently of the whole meaning of the Reconstruction
amendments as that meaning was understood by
those closest to it.</p>

<p>In the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, the court dealt with an
act of Louisiana creating a single company to have exclusive
responsibility for meat-processing in New Orleans. The law
was intended to promote health and sanitation (or so the
State insisted), but local butchers attacked it as an invasion
of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme
Court would not agree. No right to be a butcher in
Louisiana inured to a “citizen of the United States” prior
to adoption of the Amendment, and the amendment gave
him none. Such rights, privileges, and immunities remained
within the jurisdiction of the States after 1868, as surely
as they had rested with the States before 1868. In terms
of the basic structure of the Union, the War of 1861-65
had changed nothing. The Fourteenth Amendment, though
it laid certain prohibitions upon the States and vested in
the Congress power to enforce those prohibitions by appropriate
legislation, never had been intended “to bring within
the power of Congress the entire domain of civil rights
heretofore belonging exclusively to the States.” Any such
interpretation would radically change “the whole theory
of the relations of the State and Federal governments to
each other, and of both these governments to the people.”
No such results, said the court, “<em>were intended by the Congress
which proposed these amendments, nor by the legislatures
which ratified them.</em>” The Fourteenth Amendment
had then been in effect only five years. Every member of
the court was familiar with the circumstances surrounding
its submission and ratification.</p>

<p>On March 1, 1875, Congress enacted a truly sweeping
Civil Rights Act. The first section asserted, affirmatively,
that “all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States
shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of ... inns,
public conveyances on land or water, theatres, and other
like places of amusement.” Five cases testing the law came
together before the Supreme Court for decision in October
1883. Harlan alone dissented from an opinion of the court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
declaring that the act went beyond the boundaries of the
power vested in the Congress by the fifth section of the
Fourteenth Amendment. What was this power? In the
view of the majority, it boiled down simply to this&mdash;a
power to enforce. To enforce what? To enforce the prohibitions
laid upon the States&mdash;that is, to adopt “corrective legislation
such as may be necessary and proper for counteracting
such laws as the States may adopt or enforce and
which, <em>by the amendment</em>, they are prohibited from making
or enforcing.” [Emphasis added.] The Civil Rights Act did
not vest in the Congress any power to adopt general legislation
dealing with the rights of the citizens, or to establish
any code of municipal law. Any such assumption, said the
court, “is certainly unsound.” The intention of the Fourteenth
Amendment was to prohibit the States from denying
to any person “those fundamental rights which are the essence
of civil freedom, namely, the right to make and enforce
contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to
inherit, purchase, lease, sell, and convey property.” Whenever
a State attempted by its own action to deny a Negro
such rights as these, a State would be in violation of the
Constitution; but until a State transgressed upon some right
<em>secured by the amendment</em>, a State could do as it wished.
Was a right to attend an integrated public school such a
right? The <em>Civil Rights Cases</em> do not suggest it for a moment.
On the contrary, the construction placed upon the
Fourteenth Amendment by the court suggests precisely the
opposite.</p>

<p>Whatever doubts might have been lingering in any quarter
were put at rest by the Supreme Court’s opinion of May
1896 in <em>Plessy</em> v. <em>Ferguson</em>. The Fourteenth Amendment
had been in operation nearly twenty-eight years. Plessy,
one-eighth Negro, challenged a Louisiana State law requiring
separate facilities for whites and Negroes on railway
lines; his principal contention was that he was thereby
denied equal protection of the laws. With only Harlan dissenting
(Brewer did not participate), the Supreme Court
expounded in clear and simple terms the “understanding”
and “contemplation” of the Fourteenth Amendment:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The object of the amendment was undoubtedly to
enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the
law, but in the nature of things it could not have been
intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to
enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or
a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory
to either. Laws permitting, and even requiring, their separation
in places where they are liable to be brought into
contact do not necessarily imply the inferiority of either
race to the other, and have generally, if not universally,
been recognized as within the competency of the State
legislatures in the exercise of their police power. <em>The
most common instance of this is connected with the
establishment of separate schools for white and colored
children, which has been held to be a valid exercise of
the legislative power even by courts of States where the
political rights of the colored race have been longest and
most earnestly enforced.</em> [Emphasis supplied.]</p>
</div>

<p>What was the primary question the United States Supreme
Court asked in the <em>Brown</em> case in June 1953? This was the
question: Whether the Congress that submitted the Fourteenth
Amendment, and the States that ratified it, understood
or contemplated that the amendment was intended to
abolish segregation in public schools.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Congress surely did not understand
or contemplate this: The Congress itself provided for racially
separate schools in the District of Columbia. Over a long
period of years following adoption of the amendment, States
both North and South continued to operate separate schools,
without protest or interference of any sort from Congress.</p>

<p>Just as plainly, the States that ratified the amendment did
not understand or contemplate that it was intended to abolish
segregation in schools: One after another, they provided for
racially separate schools in the same breath with which they
ratified the amendment.</p>

<p>And if one seeks in the judicial pronouncements of the
day for independent evidence of what the Congress and
the States understood and contemplated the amendment to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
mean the evidence is overwhelming: The power of the States
to maintain separate schools was “generally, if not universally”
held to be completely in accord with the Fourteenth
Amendment. The seven justices who united in <em>Plessy</em> were all
mature men at the time the amendment became effective in
1868. Edward D. White of Louisiana, the youngest, was
then twenty-three, Brown of Michigan was thirty-two, Fuller
of Illinois thirty-five, Field of California fifty-two, Gray of
Massachusetts forty, Shiras of Pennsylvania, thirty-six, and
Peckham of New York thirty. From a standpoint of constitutional
law, who could have known the understanding
and contemplation of the amendment better than they?
They grew up with it. And in 1896, when they handed down
the Plessy opinion, they were men of fifty-one to eighty, in
a position to look back maturely upon twenty-eight years of
political life under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>


<p class="p2">The other two questions of a general nature posed by
the Supreme Court in June 1953 may be dealt with more
briefly. Much of the ground has been covered already.
These were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Question 2: If neither the Congress in submitting nor
the States in ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment understood
that compliance with it would require the immediate
abolition of segregation in public schools, was it
nevertheless the understanding of the framers of the
amendment</em></p>

<p><em>(a) that future Congresses might, in the exercise of
their power under Section 5 of the amendment, abolish
such segregation, or</em></p>

<p><em>(b) that it would be within the judicial power, in the
light of future conditions, to construe the amendment
as abolishing such segregation of its own force?</em></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Question 3: On the assumption that the answers to
Questions 2 (a) and (b) do not dispose of the issue, is it
within the judicial power, in construing the amendment,
to abolish segregation in public schools?</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>

<p>Question 2 (a) may best be answered by studying the
Fourteenth Amendment in terms of political power. What
is the Fourteenth? Obviously, it is first of all a prohibition
upon the States. It is not primarily a grant of power to the
Congress. Its thrust is negative: The States shall not make;
the States shall not enforce; the States shall not abridge; the
States shall not deprive; the States shall not deny. Section
3 carries an incidental delegation of power to the Congress,
authorizing the removal of political disabilities imposed
upon Confederate soldiers, and Section 5 vests in the Congress
a power “to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the
provisions of this article.”</p>

<p>Would an act of Congress prohibiting the States from
maintaining racially separate schools be “appropriate legislation,
enforcing the provisions of this article”? The framers
of the Fourteenth Amendment did not think so. They did
not regard the right to attend a particular school as a “civil
right.” Well after the amendment became operative, Sumner
and other abolitionist leaders in the Congress several times
introduced legislation having this end; twice they got such a
bill through the Senate (1872 and 1874), on tie votes broken
by the Vice-President, but they were never able to get a bill
through the House. And in the Civil Rights Act of 1875,
an effort to prohibit racially separate schools was defeated
decisively.</p>

<p>The power vested in Congress in the fifth section is no
general grant of power. It is limited to legislation appropriate
to enforcing the provisions “of this article.” And until it
can be shown that one of the provisions “of this article” was
intended to prohibit to the States the power to maintain racially
separate schools, it cannot be shown that Congress
appropriately could enact legislation having that end.</p>

<p>No provision of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes such
a prohibition on the States. Therefore, no act of the Congress
validly could seek to enforce such a prohibition.</p>

<p>And surely it is all the more evident, to get at Questions
2 (b) and 3, that nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment, or
in any other provision of the Constitution or act of Congress,
ever was intended to give the Supreme Court the power to
abolish segregation in public schools by its own fiat. If the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
power to accomplish this end rested in Federal authority at
all, it rested in the hands of the Congress. The court might
decide whether an act of the Congress prohibiting such
schools in the States were “appropriate legislation” to enforce
provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, but the court has
no legislative authority of any sort. As the court itself said
in the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, the amendment was not intended
to make the court “a perpetual censor upon all legislation
of the States, on the civil rights of their own citizens,
with authority to nullify such as it did not approve as consistent
with those rights as they existed at the time of the
adoption of this amendment.”</p>

<p>Question 3, it will be noticed, goes beyond Question 2 (b).
In Question 2 (b), the court was still concerned with the
intention of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment: Did
the framers understand in 1866 that some day the court,
in the light of future conditions, could construe the amendment
to abolish school segregation of its own force? But in
Question 3, the framers are abandoned: Is it within the judicial
power <em>today</em>, the court inquired, without regard to
history, for the court itself to abolish school segregation by
placing a new construction on the amendment?</p>

<p>In the brief they filed in response to the court’s inquiries,
attorneys for the Southern States said this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Certainly judicial power exists if the only question be
whether this court is empowered to make an enforceable
decision. But to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment as
authority for the judicial abolition of school segregation
would be an invasion of the legislative power and an exact
reversal of the intent of the framers of the amendment.</p>
</div>

<p>Yes, the court has power. Hughes’ cynical remark contains
grim truth: Judges are restrained only by the Constitution,
and the Constitution is what the judges say it is. But if the
ethical tradition of our society teaches us one thing (wholly
apart from the judicial tradition), it is that might and right
ought always to be carefully distinguished. And on no nine
men in the world does this responsibility rest more heavily
than on the nine members of the court. Defense counsel in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
the school cases quoted Mr. Justice Cardozo: “Judges have,
of course, the power, though not the right, to ignore the
mandate of a statute, and render judgment in despite of it.
They have the power, though not the right, to travel beyond
the walls of the interstices, the bounds set to judicial innovation
by precedent and custom. None the less, by that abuse
of power, they violate the law.”</p>

<p>Judges are not supposed to violate the law, to constitute
themselves a super-legislature, to plunge beyond the bounds
of the Constitution itself. And no body of critics has said
this more frequently than the judges themselves.</p>

<p>In the famous case of <em>United States</em> v. <em>Butler</em>, (297 U. S.
1), holding that the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1935
exceeded the power vested in the Congress to regulate commerce,
the Supreme Court divided violently&mdash;but both the
majority and the minority, in their discussions of judicial
power and responsibility, made the same points. “The only
power the court has,” said the majority, “if such it may be
called, is the power of judgment. This court neither approves
nor condemns any legislative policy. Its delicate and difficult
office is to ascertain and declare whether the legislation is in
accordance with, or in contravention of, the provisions of
the Constitution; and, having done that, its duty ends.”
Harlan Stone, in the magnificent dissent in which Brandeis
and Cardozo joined, expressed the responsibility of the court
in this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The power of courts to declare a statute unconstitutional
is subject to two guiding principles of decision which ought
never to be absent from judicial consciousness. One is that
courts are concerned only with the power to enact statutes,
not with their wisdom. The other is that while unconstitutional
exercise of power by the executive and legislative
branches of the government is subject to judicial restraint,
the only check upon our own exercise of power is our own
sense of self-restraint. For the removal of unwise laws from
the statute books, appeal lies not to the courts but to the
ballot and to the processes of democratic government.</p>
</div>

<p>Did the Supreme Court, in the <em>School Segregation Cases</em>,
have the power to abolish segregation by placing its own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
contemporary construction on the Fourteenth Amendment?
By casting aside Stone’s “sense of self-restraint,” and by substituting
their own notions of what was right for the plain
history of what was constitutional, the judges could assume
that naked power. In the end, that was what they did&mdash;in
violation of precepts they themselves had pronounced eloquently
in other cases.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Black, for example, was solidly on the side of
judicial tradition in 1946, in <em>Morgan</em> v. <em>Virginia</em> (328 U. S.
373). The question was whether a Virginia law, requiring
separate seats for white and colored passengers on buses,
placed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.
A majority of the court thought it did, but Black, though he
agreed entirely with the result of the majority’s ruling, protested
strongly that the power to regulate commerce was a
power vested in the Congress and not in the courts. Yet in
a series of cases, the court had nullified State laws just as it
was nullifying Virginia’s enactment in the <em>Morgan</em> case. “I
thought then, and still believe,” said Black, “that in these
cases the court was assuming the role of a ‘super-legislature’
in determining matters of governmental policy.” Where was
Mr. Justice Black in May 1954?</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Frankfurter has expounded many times upon
the obligation upon the court never to exceed its judicial
powers. The question in <em>Board of Education</em> v. <em>Barnette</em> (319
U. S. 634), was whether West Virginia could compel its
public school children to salute the flag. Five times, the
Supreme Court had held that such a requirement was not in
violation of the Constitution. Now, in 1943, with the shift of
two justices, the holding was reversed. Frankfurter’s eloquent
dissent provides a moving statement of the philosophy by
which judges should be guided in contemplating their judicial
power:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One who belongs to the most vilified and persecuted
minority in history is not likely to be insensible to the
freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution. Were my purely
personal attitude relevant, I should wholeheartedly associate
myself with the general libertarian views in the court’s
opinion, representing as they do the thought and action of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
a lifetime. But as judges we are neither Jew nor Gentile,
neither Catholic nor agnostic. We owe equal attachment
to the Constitution and are equally bound by our judicial
obligations whether we derive our citizenship from the
earliest or the latest immigrants to these shores. As a member
of this court I am not justified in writing my private
notions of policy into the Constitution, no matter how
deeply I may cherish them or how mischievous I may
deem their disregard.... It can never be emphasized too
much that one’s own opinion about the wisdom or evil of
a law should be excluded altogether when one is doing
one’s duty on the bench. The only opinion of our own
even looking in that direction that is material is our opinion
whether legislators could in reason have enacted such a
law.</p>
</div>

<p>Much as he detested the West Virginia statute, Frankfurter
found it impossible to deny that reasonable legislators could
have passed the flag-salute law. He was guided to this conclusion
by “the light of all the circumstances” and by “the
history of this question in this court.” Thirteen Justices of
the Supreme Court in other years had found such laws within
the constitutional authority of the States. In view of this “impressive
judicial sanction,” how could the power be now prohibited
to the States? In the past, said Frankfurter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">this court has from time to time set its views of policy
against that embodied in legislation by finding laws in conflict
with what was called “the spirit of the Constitution.”
Such undefined destructive power was not conferred on
this court by the Constitution. Before a duly enacted law
can be judicially nullified, it must be forbidden by some
explicit restriction upon political authority in the Constitution.
Equally inadmissible is the claim to strike down legislation
because to us as individuals it seems opposed to the
“plan and purpose” of the Constitution. That is too tempting
a basis for finding in one’s personal views the purposes
of the Founders.</p>

<p>The uncontrollable power wielded by this court brings
it very close to the most sensitive areas of public affairs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
As appeal from legislation to adjudication becomes more
frequent, and its consequences more far-reaching, judicial
self-restraint becomes more and not less important, lest we
unwarrantably enter social and political domains wholly
outside our concern.</p>
</div>

<p>What had become of these views on the part of Mr. Justice
Frankfurter in May 1954? By that time, not merely thirteen
Justices, but more than thirty members of the court over a
period of fifty-eight years had upheld the constitutionality of
racially separate schools. More impressive judicial sanction
scarcely could be imagined. And what is to be said of an
opinion, in a highly sensitive area of public affairs, not even
rationalized by “the spirit of the Constitution” or the “plan
and purpose” of the Constitution, but rather by “the effect
of segregation on public education” and “the extent of psychological
knowledge”? These provided the rationale of the
<em>Brown</em> decision, but Mr. Justice Frankfurter did not open
his mouth in dissent.</p>

<p>Did the court have the power to do what it did? Mr. Justice
Douglas, another of the nine, in other days had warned that
long-run stability is best achieved when social and economic
problems of the State and nation are kept under political
management of the people. Writing in <cite>49 Columbia Law
Review</cite> some years ago, he observed sagely that “it is when
a judiciary with life tenure seeks to write its social and
economic creed into the Charter that instability is created.”
In May 1954, Mr. Justice Douglas did his bit to create just
that instability.</p>

<p>Did the court have the power? That was the essence of
Question 3. It was the court’s most profound inquiry, for it
probed the very soul of judicial limitation and responsibility.
Serious consideration of Question 3 would have required of
the judges a respect for the wisdom and integrity of scores
of judges and hundreds of State and Federal legislators, all
equally sworn to uphold the Constitution, who had preceded
them. The question should have suggested the utmost restraint,
the most selfless exercise of judicial discipline. “Is
it within the judicial power, in construing the amendment, to
abolish segregation in public schools?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>

<p>“What is truth?” said jesting Pilate; and would not stay
for an answer.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The <em>School Segregation Cases</em> came up for reargument
before the Supreme Court on December 8, 1953. By this
time, the Kansas case was moot (it is one of the many
ironies of the story that the school cases should be styled as
<em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education of Topeka</em>, taking their name
from a controversy that had been settled by the time the
opinion came down), but the cases from Virginia, South
Carolina, and Delaware were still hotly at issue. The cast
of lawyers was the same, and again, questions from the
bench seemed to indicate a continuing division within the
court.</p>

<p>Counsel for the Negro plaintiffs, grappling with Question
1, attempted to show that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended
by its framers and adopters to have a “broad, general
scope.” John W. Davis and T. Justin Moore, carrying the
brunt of argument for the South, relied upon the more
tangible history of what actually happened in terms of
racially separate schools. Davis placed particular emphasis
upon the action of the Southern States in creating separate
school systems, without objection from Congress, even as
they ratified the amendment. Sumner and his fellow radicals
might not have wanted to challenge such Northern allies as
Pennsylvania and Ohio, but “if there were any place where
sponsors of the amendment would have blown the bugle
for mixed schools, surely it would have been in those eight
States of Reconstruction legislation.”</p>

<p>Frankfurter kept asking the various attorneys to explain
why the Congress itself never had adopted legislation to
prohibit the States from maintaining racially separate schools.
Defense counsel said the Congress had no power to do so;
attorneys for the Negro plaintiffs said Congress had the
power, but opponents of segregation never had had the
votes. Frankfurter put an embarrassing question to J. Lee
Rankin, who as Assistant Attorney General had joined forces
with the NAACP. “Realistically,” Frankfurter suggested, “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
reason this case is here is that action couldn’t be attained
from Congress. Certainly it would be much stronger from
your point of view if Congress had acted, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>Rankin agreed, but insisted that the court could achieve
the desired end by judicial pronouncement as well as the
Congress could achieve it by legislative action. Frankfurter
persisted, taking judicial notice of eighty-five years of
segregation in Washington:</p>

<p>“Is it to be said fairly that not only did Congress not
exercise the power under Section 5 with reference to the
States but, in a realm in which it has exclusive authority,
it enacted legislation to the contrary? Are you saying that
legislation does not mean anything but what it does? It just
segregates, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” Rankin replied. “You have to find
a conscious determination by Congress that segregation was
permitted under the Fourteenth Amendment.”</p>

<p>“You think legislation by Congress is like the British
Empire&mdash;something that is acquired in a fit of absent-mindedness?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t make that charge before this court,” said
Rankin stiffly, “and I don’t want to be quoted in that
manner.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Frankfurter’s questions exposed the weakness
of the plaintiffs’ historical justifications. Rankin’s astonishing
idea&mdash;that Congress never really had thought much
about what it was doing, during all the years since 1868
in which it had provided annually for segregated schools
in Washington&mdash;was echoed in feeble attempts to explain
away the judicial precedents. Jackson and Reed asked Rankin
how he could account for decisions of Northern courts,
in such cases as <em>Garnes</em>, <em>King</em>, and <em>Cory</em>, holding that the
Fourteenth Amendment did not reach public schools. Rankin
replied weakly that “apparently there was no detailed study
of the history and background of the Fourteenth Amendment.”
This was too much for Jackson: “These men lived
with the thing,” he said; “they didn’t have to go to books.”</p>

<p>The question that most troubled Jackson, however, was
the key question of judicial power. He wondered aloud if it
were appropriate “for the court, after all that has intervened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
to exercise this power instead of leaving it to Congress.”
Thurgood Marshall, for the plaintiffs, insisted that theories
of a dynamic, growing Constitution abundantly justified the
court in reversing Plessy and in placing its own contemporary
construction on the Amendment. John W. Davis, for the defense,
strongly disagreed: “At some time to every principle
comes a moment of repose, when it has been so often announced,
so confidently relied upon, so long continued, that
it passes the limits of judicial discretion and disturbance.”</p>

<p>Painstakingly, counsel for the Southern States called the
roll of precedents supporting&mdash;or not disturbing&mdash;the long-established
doctrine of “separate but equal.” The <em>Plessy</em>
case of 1896 had been followed in December 1899 by
<em>Cumming</em> v. <em>Richmond County Board of Education</em> (175
U. S. 528). Here the facts were that a Georgia county had
closed its Negro high school and required local Negro high
school students to go into Augusta for schooling, in order
to convert the high school to the needs of three-hundred
elementary pupils. The Negro high school pupils sought an
injunction to upset this arrangement. And though the denial
of equal facilities locally might seem plain, a <em>unanimous</em>
Supreme Court found no merit in the Negroes’ claim. Some
of the students might be inconvenienced by the requirement
that they attend one of the three Negro high schools in
nearby Augusta, but their inconvenience had to be set
against the needs of the elementary children. Further, nothing
constructive would be gained by closing the white high
school merely because the Negro high school was no longer
operating. “Under the circumstances disclosed,” said the
court, “we cannot say that this action ... was, <em>within the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment</em>, a denial by the
State to the plaintiffs and those associated with them of the
equal protection of the law, or of any privileges belonging
to them as citizens of the United States. The education of
the people in schools maintained by State taxation is a
matter belonging to the respective States, and any interference
on the part of Federal authority with the management
of such schools cannot be justified except in the case
of a clear and unmistakable disregard of rights secured by
the supreme law of the land.” [Emphasis supplied.] It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
curious, one may note in passing, that persons who so reverently
admire Mr. Justice Harlan’s dissent of 1896 in <em>Plessy</em>
customarily fail altogether to acknowledge that it was Mr.
Justice Harlan who spoke in 1899 for a unanimous court
in <em>Cumming</em>.</p>

<p>The court’s pronouncement in <em>Cumming</em> was cited the
following year in the New York Court of Appeals (161 N. Y.
598), when Negro petitioners challenged the right and power
of Queens Borough to maintain separate schools. The New
York court refused to disturb the system: “It is equal school
facilities and accommodations that are required to be furnished,
and not equal social opportunities.”</p>

<p>In November 1908, the Supreme Court considered a suit
brought by Berea College against the Commonwealth of
Kentucky (211 U. S. 45). Berea, a private college, had been
operating as a racially integrated institution. A State law was
enacted making it unlawful for any corporation chartered in
Kentucky to maintain a private school on such a basis. On
the grounds that the law was within Kentucky’s power to
regulate Kentucky corporations, a majority of the Supreme
Court held the law valid. Harlan dissented warmly. He
thought Berea’s right to admit pupils of its own choosing to
its classrooms was “a liberty inherent in the freedom secured
by fundamental law,” but he did not wish to be misunderstood:
“Of course what I have said has no reference to regulations
prescribed for public schools, established at the pleasure
of the State and maintained at the public expense.”</p>

<p>Six years later, the generic question of “separate but equal”
was again before the Supreme Court, in <em>McCabe</em> v. <em>Atchison,
Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company</em> (235 U. S. 151). A
Negro passenger had sued to halt enforcement of an Oklahoma
law requiring racial separation on coaches. The trial
court had dismissed the suit by calling attention to <em>Plessy</em> and
saying that the power of the States to require separate but
equal accommodations “could no longer be considered an
open question.” Said Hughes for a unanimous Supreme
Court: “There is no reason to doubt the correctness of that
conclusion.”</p>

<p>Thirteen years elapsed. Membership on the court changed.
On November 21, 1927, when the court decided <em>Gong Lum</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
v. <em>Rice</em> (275 U. S. 78), Taft was Chief Justice; his brothers
included such giants of the law as Holmes, Brandeis, and
Stone. The question of the power of the States to maintain
racially separate but equal schools was put squarely before
the court. Mississippi had insisted that a Chinese child, Martha
Lum, attend a Negro high school in Bolivar County instead
of a white high school. This was what Taft said, speaking
for a <em>unanimous</em> court:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The question here is whether a Chinese citizen of the
United States is denied equal protection of the laws when
he is classed among the colored races and furnished facilities
for education equal to that offered to all, whether
white, brown, yellow or black. Were this a new question,
it would call for very full argument and consideration, but
we think that it is the same question which has been many
times decided to be within the constitutional power of the
State legislature to settle without intervention of the Federal
courts under the Federal Constitution.... The decision
is within the discretion of the State in regulating its public
schools, <em>and does not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment</em>.
[Emphasis supplied.]</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Gong Lum</em> case was in 1927. Eleven years later the
Supreme Court dealt with a suit brought by Lloyd Gaines,
a Negro, seeking admission to the law school of the University
of Missouri (305 U. S. 337). The <em>Gaines</em> case is important,
because it sometimes is said that it heralded in 1938
the end of “separate but equal” in 1954. It did no such
thing. The State of Missouri then had no law school for
Negroes; the practice was to pay tuition fees, out of State,
for the few Negro students seeking legal education. Other
Negro college students attended Lincoln University in St.
Louis, where Missouri sought to fulfill its obligation to provide
the same general advantages of higher education for
Negroes that it provided for whites by furnishing equal facilities
in separate schools. Chief Justice Hughes said for the
court that this was a method, “<em>the validity of which has been
sustained by our decisions</em>.” He was sympathetic to Missouri’s
plan to build Lincoln University into an institution genuinely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
equal to the University of Missouri at Columbia. “But commendable
as is that action, the fact remains that instruction
in law for Negroes is not now afforded by the State, either
at Lincoln University or elsewhere.” The court therefore ordered
Gaines admitted to the Missouri Law School. McReynolds
dissented, with Butler joining him. They felt Missouri’s
offer to pay Gaines’ tuition in a nearby law school of good
standing would provide the student with abundant opportunity
to study law “if perchance that is the thing really desired.”
In attempting in good faith to meet the constitutionally
sanctioned requirements of separate but equal, said McReynolds,
“the State should not be unduly hampered through
theorization inadequately restrained by experience.”</p>

<p>Three other cases that were reviewed in the oral argument
before the Supreme Court in December 1953 also dealt with
higher education at the graduate-school level. The circumstances
in <em>Sipuel</em> v. <em>Board of Regents of the University of
Oklahoma</em> (332 U. S. 630) paralleled the circumstances of
the <em>Gaines</em> case; the court entered no more than a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per curiam</i>
order directing that <em>Gaines</em> be followed. On June 5, 1950, the
last two cases were decided: <em>Sweatt</em> v. <em>Painter</em> (339 U. S.
629) and <em>McLaurin</em> v. <em>Oklahoma State Regents for Higher
Education</em> (339 U. S. 637). In both opinions, the court,
speaking through Chief Justice Vinson, was careful to emphasize
that it was following <em>Gaines</em> (that is, that it was
following “separate but equal”) and was not reexamining
<em>Plessy</em> at all. In the <em>Sweatt</em> case, Texas had attempted to
establish a Negro law school at Austin that would be the
equal of its University of Texas Law School in Houston.
Relying upon the “intangibles that make for greatness in a
law school,” the court held such equality impossible of attainment.
Similarly, in the <em>McLaurin</em> case, in which Oklahoma
had sought to segregate a Negro graduate in the use of
library and cafeteria facilities, Vinson held for the court that
“<em>under these circumstances</em>,” the Fourteenth Amendment
precluded any distinction in treatment of students based upon
race.</p>

<p>Regardless of one’s views on the rightness or wrongness of
segregation in the public schools, how are these precedents
fairly to be characterized? Plainly, they form one unbroken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
chain, reaching back to the very ratification of the Fourteenth
Amendment: <em>Garnes</em> in Ohio, <em>Stoutmeyer</em> in Nevada, <em>Ward</em>
in California, <em>Cory</em> in Indiana, <em>Bertonneau</em> in Louisiana,
<em>King</em> in New York, <em>Lehew</em> in Missouri, <em>Plessy</em> in Louisiana,
<em>Cumming</em> in Georgia, <em>Berea</em> in Kentucky, <em>McCabe</em> in Oklahoma,
<em>Gong Lum</em> in Mississippi, <em>Gaines</em> in Missouri&mdash;in
every one of these, extending from 1871 to 1938, the doctrine
of “separate but equal” had been judicially sanctioned
as not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. And in
<em>Sipuel</em>, <em>McLaurin</em>, and <em>Sweatt</em> the doctrine had simply been
ruled not applicable in the peculiar circumstances of graduate-school
instruction.</p>

<p>This was the chain the court snapped in the <em>School Segregation
Cases</em>. Six months after the case had been reargued,
on May 17, 1954, Chief Justice Warren spoke for a unanimous
court in overruling and discarding this uniform interpretation
of more than eighty years. The text of the court’s
opinion appears in the Appendix, along with its companion
decision in the <em>Bolling</em> case from the District of Columbia.
Here it will be seen that the court blandly dismissed the
massive evidence of “intent” with a regal hand: The evidence
was “inconclusive.” Then, disdaining every rule of jurisprudence
which says that law cases should be decided on points
of law, the court delivered itself of some homilies on the
importance of education: “Today, education is perhaps the
most important function of State and local governments.”
Everyone must have an education: “It is the very foundation
of good citizenship. It is a principal instrument in awakening
the child to cultural values.” Said the court:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We come then to the question presented: Does segregation
of children in public schools solely on the basis of
race, even though the physical facilities and other “tangible”
factors may be equal, deprive the children of the
minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe
that it does.</p>
</div>

<p>That was the key paragraph. The court went on to assert
that the “intangible considerations” it had found to be important
in graduate-school instruction apply with added force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to children in grade and high schools. “To separate them
from others of similar age and qualifications solely because
of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their
status in the community that may affect their hearts and
minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.” Whatever may
have been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time
of <em>Plessy</em>, said the court, “this finding is amply supported by
modern authority.” And the court inserted its famous Footnote
11 to prove it.</p>

<p>This footnote directed the inquisitive reader to seven
sources. The first was a paper prepared by Kenneth B. Clark,
“The Effect of Prejudice and Discrimination on Personality
Development,” delivered at the 1950 White House Conference
on Children and Youth; Clark, a professor of psychology
at the College of the City of New York, was then at
least presumptively on the payroll of the NAACP&mdash;he was
“social science consultant for the NAACP’s legal and educational
division.” A second source was “Personality in the
Making,” by Helen Leland Witmer and Ruth Kotinsky. The
third was a report of a survey conducted for the American
Jewish Congress in 1947 by Max Deutscher and Isidor Chein.
They sent a questionnaire to 849 social scientists, asking, first
in the affirmative and then in the negative, “[Do you] believe
that enforced segregation has (has not) a detrimental
psychological effect on members of the racial or religious
groups which are segregated?” A second question, similarly
phrased, sought the social scientists’ opinions on whether such
segregation has detrimental effects on the majority group imposing
the segregation. All told, 517 of those queried returned
the questionnaire (32 of the 517 were from the
South). Not surprisingly, 90 per cent of the 517 obligingly
answered Ja to the first question and 83 per cent said Ja to
the second. Had there been an opportunity to put Deutscher
and Chein on a witness stand, counsel for the South might
have sought clarification on what was meant by “enforced,”
what by “segregation,” and what by “detrimental,” and rebuttal
witnesses might have been summoned to testify on the
effects, detrimental or otherwise, of enforced integration on
the majority group.</p>

<p>The fourth authority cited by the court was a paper by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
Chein in a publication of such large obscurity and small circulation
that few persons can have examined it: “What are
the Psychological Effects of Segregation under Conditions of
Equal Facilities,” in Volume 3 of the <cite>International Journal
of Opinion and Attitude Research</cite> (1949). Fifth on the list
was “Educational Costs in Discrimination and National Welfare,”
by Theodore Brameld, then a professor of educational
philosophy at the University of Minnesota. The sixth reference
was to Edward Franklin Frazier’s <cite>The Negro in the
United States</cite>. Frazier is a Negro sociologist, professor of
sociology at Howard University, who served as chairman of
UNESCO’s committee of experts on race.</p>

<p>And finally, said the court, “see generally Myrdal, <cite>An
American Dilemma</cite>.”</p>

<p>“We conclude,” said the court, “that in the field of public
education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place.
<em>Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal</em>.” [Emphasis
supplied.] That final sentence contained perhaps the
greatest irony of them all, for unless words have lost their
meaning, the court here decreed equality for the Negro by
finding the Negro innately not equal. What else did the court
mean? Here we are told, on the authority of the most eminent
court in the world, that if one-hundred Negro pupils
are put to study in one building, and one-hundred white pupils
are put to study in an identical building, the first group
of pupils, who have been segregated solely on the basis of
race, will make up a school <em>inherently</em> unequal to the other.
“Inherently” comes from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">haerere</i>, to stick; it means
“firmly infixed; belonging by nature.” And when the court
concluded that separate schools for Negroes are inherently
unequal, it made a judicial finding of fact with which a great
many Southerners would find themselves in wry agreement.</p>

<p>That was the substance of the <em>Brown</em> decision. Because
of the predictable impact of the ruling and the great variety
of local conditions, the court asked for reargument on the
formulation of specific decrees. A year later, on May 31,
1955, a supplementary opinion (this also appears in full in
the Appendix) sent the cases back to the trial courts with
instructions to enter decrees ordering “the parties to these
cases admitted to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
basis with all deliberate speed.” By that time, Kansas
had abandoned segregation altogether in its schools; so had
the District of Columbia; so had Delaware over much of the
State. In the course of time, Prince Edward County, Virginia,
was to abandon public education rather than submit to compulsory
desegregation of its schools. The public schools of
Clarendon County, S. C., are still operating as I write, in the
spring of 1962, as completely segregated as they were in the
spring of 1954. The new Negro schools are bright and shining
and consolidated, and some of the children of the original
plaintiffs of 1951, it is said, are placidly attending them.</p>

<p>What was wrong with the <em>Brown</em> decision? The Sibley
Commission in Georgia summarized the South’s protest in
two sweeping sentences:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We consider this decision utterly unsound on the facts;
contrary to the clear intent of the Fourteenth Amendment;
a usurpation of legislative function through judicial process;
and an invasion of the reserved rights of States. We
further consider that, <em>putting aside the question of segregation</em>,
this decision presents a clear and present danger
to our system of constitutional government, because it
places what the court calls “modern authority” in sociology
and psychology above the ancient authority of the
law, and because it places the transitory views of the Supreme
Court above the legislative power of Congress, the
settled construction of the Constitution, and the reserved
sovereignty of the several States. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>
</div>

<p>If the student of American government can do as the
Sibley commission suggests, and put aside the question of
segregation&mdash;eliminate all the emotional overtones of “prejudice”
and “discrimination” and “second-class citizens”&mdash;he
will get a clearer picture of the most disturbing aspect of the
<em>School Segregation Cases</em>. One of the most cherished myths
of American tradition, as strong and as insubstantial as any
doctrine of religion, is that ours is “a government of laws,
not men.” Viewed coldly and nakedly, the proposition is palpably
absurd; wine is wine, and bread is bread. But by some
devout act of political transubstantiation, the faith of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
American people has imbued this doctrine with a special
venerability: We have been reared to believe that law exists
metaphysically, above and beyond the mortal men who enforce
it. As an institution, the high court commands respect,
not for the nine frail vessels beneath the robes, but out of
deference to the higher, holier grail they represent.</p>

<p>And this was what the court shattered in the <em>Brown</em> case:
The myth, the grail, the mystery of the law. “The judicial
function is that of interpretation,” Sutherland once said; “it
does not include the power of amendment under the guise
of interpretation.” Cardozo said the same thing: “We are
not at liberty to revise while professing to construe.” Hughes
said it too: “The power of this court is not to amend, but
only to expound the Constitution as an agency of the sovereign
people who made it and who alone have authority to
alter or unmake it.”</p>

<p>But the court disdained these ancient and elementary rules.
“By its decision in the <em>Brown</em> case,” former Justice Byrnes
has said, “the court did not interpret the Constitution. It
really amended the Constitution.” This the court had no legal
or moral right to do. It had only the power to do it&mdash;the
absolute power, in Acton’s famous phrase, that left unrestrained,
corrupts absolutely.</p>

<p class="p2">I had not intended to write a “Part III” for this book.
The object was to put forth a brief for the South in the
single narrow field of racially separate public schools; my
thought was to summarize and argue the law and the evidence
of <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em> as the South views
them, and to leave such issues as “sit-ins,” and voting rights,
and the Negro’s future for another day. Yet a familiar part
of the pleading in almost any case is the prayer of the petitioner,
and there is something more to be said for the South
in that hypothetical role.</p>

<p>Patience, the South would ask of its adversaries: Be patient;
be tolerant of imperfection; be mindful that in these
difficult areas of race and race relations, wisdom and virtue
do not reside exclusively in the North, nor sin and ignorance
exclusively in the South. The white man most surely has been
at fault; that is conceded. But in his own way, the black man
has been at fault too. And in neither racial camp can these
faults be corrected in the twinkling of a generation.</p>

<p>The apostles of instant innovation, crying zealously for
change, do not comprehend the elemental nature of the forces
they are dealing with. “All is race,” said Disraeli in <cite>Tancred</cite>;
“there is no other truth.” The earliest history of man reflects
an awareness of racial distinctions; in one fashion or another,
discrimination has existed through all recorded time, and
“prejudice,” if you please, like the poor, has been with us
always. It exists among the Negro people themselves. It exists
around the world, and may be seen in especially cruel and
virulent forms in some of those nations said to be so terribly
offended by the manifestations of segregation that remain in
the American South. The beam in the eye of Herman Talmadge
is small against the mote in the eye of Mr. Nehru.
The Old World has lived with these problems several millennia
longer than the New, but it has solved them not better;
in truth, it has solved them much less well, and in most
cases, it has not solved them at all.</p>

<p>As a creature of the law, racial segregation in the United
States is dead. The voices once confidently raised in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
South, crying that the court would reverse itself in time,
have all but died out now. The court will not reverse itself.
On February 26, 1962, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per curiam</i> opinion rebuked a Mississippi
Federal court in icy terms: “We have settled beyond
question that no State may require racial segregation of interstate
or intrastate transportation facilities. The question is
no longer open; it is foreclosed as a litigable issue.” (<em>Bailey</em>
v. <em>Patterson</em>, 30 LW 4164.) Similarly, the court has plunged
far beyond the reasoning it advanced in <em>Brown</em> as a justification
for prohibiting segregation in the schools; the hearts and
minds of children, the importance of education, and the
intangibles of a classroom do not figure at all in cases that
involve golf courses, courthouse cafeterias, and the rest
rooms of public buildings. Many staunch Southerners, declaring
themselves unwilling to surrender, do not realize that as
a matter of law, the war is over. There is now not the
slightest possibility of a constitutional amendment to undo
what the court did; the Congress will never pass a law that
sanctions segregation in a public institution; the court is
unanimous in its resolution, and some of its members are
young. The Southern State that puts reliance hereafter in any
law requiring racial separation is relying upon a vain and
useless thing. We should be better off, as a matter of law, if
Southern legislatures would go through their Codes with an
art gum, erasing the word “Negro” wherever it appears.
Statutory defenses against segregation, apart from any remaining
value they may have in obtaining the law’s delays,
are useless.</p>

<p>These are harsh truths for the South, but the South would
do well to grasp them; once understood, they suggest a
course of events in which accommodation may be found
within the broad structure of a voluntary society. Ovid is
sufficient authority for the maxim that nothing is stronger
than custom; and by relying upon custom, and freedom, and
precepts of the law as yet uncorrupted by the court, the
South&mdash;and here I mean the white South and the Negro
South alike&mdash;can discover some room to turn around in.</p>

<p>Virginia has pointed a way toward such an accommodation,
so far as education is concerned, in its freedom-of-choice
program. Under an act of the General Assembly of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
1958, every child in Virginia has a <em>right</em> to choose between
attending a public school or a nonprofit, nonsectarian private
school. The law has nothing to do with segregation or
desegregation. The modest tuition grants provided in the law
(in no case is a grant higher than the local per-pupil cost
in public schools) are intended to represent each child’s
equal share in a total appropriation for purposes of education,
and the State stands indifferent to the child’s way of
spending it: Public or private, it is all the same to the
Commonwealth, so long as the child is schooled.</p>

<p>The freedom-of-choice plan is working now, harmoniously
and effectively, in such areas of Virginia as Norfolk, Charlottesville,
and Front Royal. In each of the localities, the
public schools are desegregated; in each of the localities,
good private schools are operating. Some white families have
made one choice, some another. In a number of cases, white
children living in Albemarle County and Norfolk County
have obtained county tuition grants in order to attend the
desegregated public schools of neighboring Charlottesville
and Norfolk city. The State raises no objection. This is the
students’ right.</p>

<p>The private schools now operating in Virginia have limited
their admissions, to the best of my knowledge, to white
pupils only. This condition may change in time; nothing
prevents the organization of nonprofit schools for Negroes
only, or for Negroes and whites together. In any event, the
right of any group of parents to found a school to their
taste would appear beyond successful challenge. “The most
natural right of man,” said Tocqueville, “next to the right
of acting for himself, is that of combining his exertions
with those of his fellow creatures and of acting in common
with them. The right of association therefore appears to be
almost as inalienable in nature as the right of personal liberty.
No legislature can attack it without impairing the foundations
of society.”</p>

<p>Virginia is feeling its way carefully with the freedom-of-choice
program. In the 1960-61 school year, 8127 pupils
(or a little less than 1 per cent of the 874,000 children in
public schools) gave up their right to attend a public school
and chose, instead, to exercise their rights under the 1958<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
law. They obtained grants amounting to $1.8 million out of
total school spending (including sums for capital outlays)
of some $290 million. Public school administrators, many
of whom are fearful of private school competition and
jealously opposed to the program, tend to regard the grants
as a net cost&mdash;as something taken away from them. Plainly
this is not true. About $200,000 in grants were taken by
pupils who applied the sums to tuition costs in neighboring
public schools, as in Charlottesville and Norfolk; other outlays
were offset by the simple absence of the pupils from
public schools&mdash;the State did not have to build classrooms
or hire teachers to teach them. When it is kept in mind that
the nonprofit private schools must meet their own capital
costs from contributions and endowments, the prospect of
an ultimate saving to the Commonwealth becomes evident.
These construction costs are a part of the price a free people
should be permitted to pay for freedom to conduct their
lives as they wish. It is inconceivable that Federal courts
should outlaw this voluntary, nondiscriminatory plan as a
mere subterfuge or circumvention of the <em>Brown</em> decision.
It emphatically is not.</p>

<p>In <em>Pierce</em> v. <em>Society of Sisters</em> (268 U. S. 510) the Supreme
Court laid down the principles on which Virginia is relying.
The opinion held unconstitutional an Oregon act of 1922
requiring children of that State to attend public schools
and public schools only. A private military academy and a
Catholic parochial school complained that the law violated
the right of parents to choose schools for their children
where the pupils would receive the sort of training the parents
wished them to have; beyond that, the law violated
the right of private schools and teachers to engage in a
useful and lawful business or profession.</p>

<p>A unanimous court, speaking through Mr. Justice McReynolds,
accepted the plaintiffs’ position entirely. Oregon’s
law “unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents
and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of
children under their control.” Their rights in this regard are
guaranteed by the Constitution and may not be abridged by
legislation which has no reasonable relation to some purpose
within the competency of the State. “The fundamental theory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose
excludes any general power of the State to standardize its
children by forcing them to accept instruction from public
teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the
State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have
the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare
him for additional obligations.”</p>

<p>As Douglas said in <em>Lerner</em> v. <em>Casey</em> (357 U. S. 468), the
liberties guaranteed to the citizen by the First and Fourteenth
amendments include “the right to believe what one
chooses, the right to differ from his neighbor, the right to
pick and choose the political philosophy that he likes best,
the right to associate with whomever he chooses, the right
to join the groups he prefers, the privilege of selecting his
own path to salvation.” And in a case upholding the right
of Negroes to associate, Mr. Justice Harlan expressed for
the court the same view that white parents take in forming
a private school for their children: “It is beyond debate
that freedom to engage in association for the advancement
of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the ‘liberty’
assured by the Fourteenth Amendment.” (<em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>,
357 U. S. 449.)</p>

<p>The high court’s opinion in the <em>School Segregation Cases</em>
did nothing to interfere with these basic concepts of individual
freedom of action in areas of education. It is important
to understand, the Fourth U. S. Circuit Court of
Appeals has said, “exactly what the Supreme Court has
decided [in <em>Brown</em>] and what it has not decided in this
case”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">It has not decided that the Federal courts are to take over
or regulate the public schools of the States. It has not
decided that the States must mix persons of different
races in the schools or must require them to attend schools,
or must deprive them of the right of choosing the schools
they attend. What it has decided, and all that it has
decided, is that a State may not deny to any person on
account of race the right to attend any school that it
maintains. This, under the decision of the Supreme Court,
the State may not do directly or indirectly; but if the
schools which it maintains are open to children of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
races, no violation of the Constitution is involved even
though the children of different races voluntarily attend
different schools, as they attend different churches.
Nothing in the Constitution or in the decision of the
Supreme Court takes away from the people the freedom
to choose the schools they attend. The Constitution, in
other words, does not require integration. It merely forbids
discrimination. It does not forbid such segregation as
the result of voluntary action. It merely forbids the use
of governmental power to enforce segregation. The Fourteenth
Amendment is a limitation upon the exercise of
power by the state or State agencies, not a limitation
upon the freedom of individuals.</p>
</div>

<p>This interpretation by an exceptionally able appellate
court offers the South, if only the South will accept it (and
if our more rabid and influential friends in the North will
abate their impatient demands), some basis for a tolerable
way of life. In its immediate application, the Supreme Court’s
decision in the four suits decided by <em>Brown</em> was not, of
course, “the supreme law of the land.” It was, as every
court opinion must be, simply the law of the case, disposing
of the controversies between the named plaintiffs
and the named defendants. Even though such suits are
“class actions,” the class in each case is limited by such
facts as those of geography; a court order directed against
Clarendon County does not require the superintendent of
schools in adjoining Sumter County to do anything. Thus,
under well-accepted principles of law, the counties and cities
of the South that are not under court order stand under
no legal obligation to alter their traditional school policies.
No law or court order requires them to integrate; no law
or court order requires them affirmatively to take any action.
True, if a point is made of it, and formal complaint of
discrimination is filed, local school officials must then yield
to the principles laid down by the Supreme Court; they
can yield voluntarily, or they can go through the motions
of a predictable court proceeding, but they cannot deny
the child by reason of his race the right to attend any public
school under their supervision.</p>

<p>This deliberate, unhurried view of the school problem
tends to madden the professional integrationist. He looks at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the progress of desegregation in the South, eight years after
<em>Brown</em>, and apart from the border States he sees:</p>

<p class="p1">These figures arouse the South’s critics, but another
fact contributes more significantly to their exasperation: The
people of the South, white and Negro together, continue to
dwell amiably side by side. Except where hired missionaries
from the NAACP can stir up a lawsuit, agitation for an
end to school segregation ranges from small to nil. The
Southern States have put these past eight years to good use
in pouring a fortune into equalization of Negro school facilities.
Old patterns persist because many Negro families, to
the disgust of the U. S. Civil Rights Commission, find the
patterns not intolerable. In Virginia, for example, Negro
parents know that they can petition successfully for admission
of their children to the nearest “white” school; local
officials no longer even resort to court delays. But three
years after collapse of Virginia’s massive resistance, fewer
than one-quarter of 1 per cent of the Negro parents have
taken the trouble to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p>

<p>This slow path toward evolutionary change should commend
itself to reasonably minded men. Whatever violence
to constitutional law was done by the <em>Brown</em> decision, it
is done; we ought not to condone it, defend it, rationalize
it, or forgive it, but we ought not to pretend that it never
happened. We of the South have to live with these new
legal principles, and accommodate our society to them. So
far as the education of children is concerned, this can be
done (1) by continuing to provide the best possible schools
our resources can provide; (2) by continuing to separate
children by race, in the certain conviction that such basic
pupil assignments violate no law or court order, and are in
accord with community wishes; and (3) by approving and
accepting individual, particular applications for transfer or
admission on a genuinely nondiscriminatory basis. And if,
in addition, entirely apart from any racial considerations
whatever, a freedom-of-choice program can be put in motion
to stimulate the growth of private education, the South’s
school problems can be controlled for a long time to come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Your petitioners are hopeful that such an approach, much
as it may annoy the advocates of compulsory integration,
will find a favorable response among men who are willing
to take the long view. It seems to us wholly in accord with
the oldest principles of federalism&mdash;principles that have
contributed much to the strength and vitality of this Republic.
It is the diversity of the States, their ability to experiment,
their right and power to respond to a variety of local conditions
and customs that together prevent the evils of excessive
centralism. “The traditions and habits of centuries
were not intended to be overthrown when the Fourteenth
Amendment was passed,” said Holmes. He remarked again:
“There is nothing that I more deprecate than the use of the
Fourteenth Amendment beyond the absolute compulsion of
its words to prevent the making of social experiments that
an important part of the community desires, in the insulated
chambers afforded by the several States, even though the
experiments may seem futile or even noxious to me and to
those whose judgment I most respect.”</p>

<p>Not only is this approach in accord with a wise federalism;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
it also offers the greatest opportunity to the Southern Negro
himself. In the course of a debate in the <cite>Saturday Review</cite>
with William Sloane Coffin, the New York-born William
F. Buckley, Jr., said this: “If it is true that the separation
of the races on account of color is nonrational, then circumstance
will in due course break down segregation. When it
becomes self-evident that biological, intellectual, cultural,
and psychic similarities among the races render social separation
atavistic, then the myths will begin to fade, as they
have done in respect of the Irish, the Italian, the Jew; then
integration will come&mdash;the right kind of integration.”</p>

<p>The South has begun to look upon its Negro people,
since <em>Brown</em>, in a new way. Shortcomings of the Negro
that earlier had been merely sensed are now acutely seen.
But this is no bad thing. Before any social ill may be
remedied, it first must be diagnosed and understood. Many
a Southerner is now sensitive to the outward and visible
signs of segregation; he was not so before. Today the detritus
of a crumbling institution may be observed at every
hand, and there are times when he squirms a little inside.
This retreat to neutrality on the white man’s part is a
necessary condition if the Negro, <em>by his own exertions</em>, is
to find an equal place in the sun. In the end, the white
man cannot do the job for him; Jim Crow is dead, but the
legal shot that felled him also put Massa in the cold, cold
ground. It is said that the high court “cast off the Negro’s
shackles”; it cast off his crutches too. The paternalism of
generations is vanishing year by year, to be replaced by a
healthy skepticism: The Negro says he’s the white man’s
equal; <em>show me</em>.</p>

<p>No decree of court, no act of Congress, can give the
Negro more than this. He has no right&mdash;no legal right, no
moral right&mdash;to intrude upon the private institutions of his
neighbors. If individual liberty means anything, it must
mean that each individual, regardless of color, is at liberty
to choose his own personal and business associates, and to
choose them for whatever reason. This the Negro must
understand. If he is to become a part of this association,
on equal terms, he must do what every other race of men
has done since time began, and that is to demonstrate his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
worth to the community he seeks to enter. For more than
three-hundred years, the white South by and large has
regarded such entry as impossible. I would be less than
honest if I did not acknowledge that a great part of the
Deep South still views the slightest yielding as anathema.
But elsewhere in my changing and unchanging land, the
old unequivocal “no” to Negro equality slowly merges into
a doubtful “maybe.” On the day that I write these concluding
paragraphs, the local transit company in Richmond has announced
employment of its first Negro bus drivers. The
story made page one; but it made just the bottom of page
one, and the Capital of the late Confederacy will not voice
the slightest ripple of objection. If these drivers make it up
the hill, others will follow. If the first Negro clerks in local
retail stores can sell themselves, the experience of one merchant
will persuade his neighbor. And the more the Negro
people can do within their own neighborhoods and business
communities, the more the white community’s retreat to
neutrality will continue.</p>

<p>I believe the South will maintain what I have termed
essential separation of the races for years to come. This
means very nearly total segregation in education, where the
intimate, personal, and prolonged association of white and
Negro boys and girls, in public schools, in massive numbers,
as social equals, is more than community attitudes will
accept. The sad example of Prince Edward County, where a
resolute rural people abandoned all public schools, offers
an instructive lesson to the advocates of frontal assault.
“We see the wisdom of Solon’s remark,” Jefferson once
observed, “that no more good must be attempted than the
nation can bear.” This essential separation also takes in such
wholly social institutions as private clubs. I cannot foresee
the integration of Protestant churches in the South. And
whatever the Supreme Court may do in time to the miscegenation
laws, ostracism, swift and certain, awaits those
who would cross this marital line. But my guess would be
that in areas of higher education, in many fields of employment,
in professional associations, in such quasi-public fields
as hotels, restaurants, and concert halls, doors that have
been closed will open one by one. And a South that once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
would have regarded these innovations with horror will
view them at first with surprise, then with regret, for a
time with distaste, and at last with indifference. As the
migration of the Negro out of the South continues, other
parts of the nation, at once benefited and handicapped for
want of the South’s experience in coexistence, will grapple
in their own fashion with the cultural and economic assimilation
of the Negro. They will not find it easy, but they
can rely upon this: The South will not intrude its views
upon theirs. This is a big country, a great country; it remains
the freest country on earth, and the Negro people
are a part of it. The law has done what it can for Negroes
as a whole; the law will do more, in specific situations. The
rest is up to time, and up to the Negroes themselves.</p>

<p class="p1 center">Appeal from the United States District Court for the
District of Kansas<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="p1 center">Argued December 9, 1952.&mdash;Reargued December 8, 1953.&mdash;Decided
May 17, 1954.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Mr. Chief Justice Warren</span> delivered the opinion of the
Court.</p>

<p>These cases come to us from the States of Kansas, South
Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware. They are premised on
different facts and different local conditions, but a common
legal question justifies their consideration together in this
consolidated opinion.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<p>In each of these cases, minors of the Negro race, through
their legal representatives, seek the aid of the courts in
obtaining admission to the public schools of their community
on a nonsegregated basis. In each instance, they had been
denied admission to schools attended by white children under
laws requiring or permitting segregation according to race.
This segregation was alleged to deprive the plaintiffs of the
equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
In each of the cases other than the Delaware case,
a three-judge federal district court denied relief to the plaintiffs
on the so-called “separate but equal” doctrine announced
by this Court in <em>Plessy</em> v. <em>Ferguson</em>, 163 U. S. 537. Under
that doctrine, equality of treatment is accorded when the
races are provided substantially equal facilities, even though
these facilities be separate. In the Delaware case, the Supreme
Court of Delaware adhered to that doctrine, but ordered
that the plaintiffs be admitted to the white schools because of
their superiority to the Negro schools.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs contend that segregated public schools are
not “equal” and cannot be made “equal,” and that hence
they are deprived of the equal protection of the laws. Because
of the obvious importance of the question presented,
the Court took jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Argument was heard in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
1952 Term, and reargument was heard this Term on certain
questions propounded by the Court.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Reargument was largely devoted to the circumstances
surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in
1868. It covered exhaustively consideration of the Amendment
in Congress, ratification by the states, then existing
practices in racial segregation, and the views of proponents
and opponents of the Amendment. This discussion and our
own investigation convince us that, although these sources
cast some light, it is not enough to resolve the problem with
which we are faced. At best, they are inconclusive. The
most avid proponents of the post-War Amendments undoubtedly
intended them to remove all legal distinctions
among “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.”
Their opponents, just as certainly, were antagonistic to both
the letter and the spirit of the Amendments and wished them
to have the most limited effect. What others in Congress
and the state legislatures had in mind cannot be determined
with any degree of certainty.</p>

<p>An additional reason for the inconclusive nature of the
Amendment’s history, with respect to segregated schools, is
the status of public education at that time.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the South,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the movement toward free common schools, supported by
general taxation, had not yet taken hold. Education of white
children was largely in the hands of private groups. Education
of Negroes was almost non-existent, and practically all
of the race were illiterate. In fact, any education of Negroes
was forbidden by law in some states. Today, in contrast,
many Negroes have achieved outstanding success in the arts
and sciences as well as in the business and professional
world. It is true that public school education at the time of
the Amendment had advanced further in the North, but the
effect of the Amendment on Northern States was generally
ignored in the congressional debates. Even in the North, the
conditions of public education did not approximate those
existing today. The curriculum was usually rudimentary;
ungraded schools were common in rural areas; the school
term was but three months a year in many states; and compulsory
school attendance was virtually unknown. As a
consequence, it is not surprising that there should be so little
in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment relating to its
intended effect on public education.</p>

<p>In the first cases in this Court construing the Fourteenth
Amendment, decided shortly after its adoption, the Court
interpreted it as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations
against the Negro race.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The doctrine of “separate but equal”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
did not make its appearance in this Court until 1896 in the
case of <em>Plessy</em> v. <em>Ferguson</em>, <em>supra</em>, involving not education
but transportation.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> American courts have since labored with
the doctrine for over half a century. In this Court, there have
been six cases involving the “separate but equal” doctrine in
the field of public education.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In <em>Cumming</em> v. <em>County Board
of Education</em>, 175 U. S. 528, and <em>Gong Lum</em> v. <em>Rice</em>, 275
U. S. 78, the validity of the doctrine itself was not challenged.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
In more recent cases, all on the graduate-school
level, inequality was found in that specific benefits enjoyed
by white students were denied to Negro students of the
same educational qualifications. <em>Missouri ex rel. Gaines</em> v.
<em>Canada</em>, 305 U. S. 337; <em>Sipuel</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 332 U. S. 631;
<em>Sweatt</em> v. <em>Painter</em>, 339 U. S. 629; <em>McLaurin</em> v. <em>Oklahoma
State Regents</em>, 339 U. S. 637. In none of these cases was it
necessary to re-examine the doctrine to grant relief to the
Negro plaintiff. And in <em>Sweatt</em> v. <em>Painter</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Court
expressly reserved decision on the question whether <em>Plessy</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
v. <em>Ferguson</em> should be held inapplicable to public education.</p>

<p>In the instant cases, that question is directly presented.
Here, unlike <em>Sweatt</em> v. <em>Painter</em>, there are findings below that
the Negro and white schools involved have been equalized,
or are being equalized, with respect to buildings, curricula,
qualifications and salaries of teachers, and other “tangible”
factors.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Our decision, therefore, cannot turn on merely a
comparison of these tangible factors in the Negro and white
schools involved in each of the cases. We must look instead to
the effect of segregation itself on public education.</p>

<p>In approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock
back to 1868 when the Amendment was adopted, or even
to 1896 when <em>Plessy</em> v. <em>Ferguson</em> was written. We must
consider public education in the light of its full development
and its present place in American life throughout the Nation.
Only in this way can it be determined if segregation in public
schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of
the laws.</p>

<p>Today, education is perhaps the most important function
of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance
laws and the great expenditures for education both
demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education
to our democratic society. It is required in the performance
of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in
the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship.
Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the
child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional
training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his
environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied
the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where
the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must
be made available to all on equal terms.</p>

<p>We come then to the question presented: Does segregation
of children in public schools solely on the basis of race,
even though the physical facilities and other “tangible” factors
may be equal, deprive the children of the minority
group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that
it does.</p>

<p>In <em>Sweatt</em> v. <em>Painter</em>, <em>supra</em>, in finding that a segregated
law school for Negroes could not provide them equal educational
opportunities, this Court relied in large part on “those
qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but
which make for greatness in a law school.” In <em>McLaurin</em> v.
<em>Oklahoma State Regents</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Court, in requiring that
a Negro admitted to a white graduate school be treated like
all other students, again resorted to intangible considerations:
“ ... his ability to study, to engage in discussions and exchange
views with other students, and, in general, to learn
his profession.” Such considerations apply with added force
to children in grade and high schools. To separate them from
others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their
race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in
the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a
way unlikely ever to be undone. The effect of this separation
on their educational opportunities was well stated by a
finding in the Kansas case by a court which nevertheless
felt compelled to rule against the Negro plaintiffs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Segregation of white and colored children in public
schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children.
The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the
law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted
as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group.
A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to
learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore,
has a tendency to [retard] the educational and mental
development of Negro children and to deprive them of
some of the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly]
integrated school system.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Whatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge
at the time of <em>Plessy</em> v. <em>Ferguson</em>, this finding is amply
supported by modern authority.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Any language in <em>Plessy</em> v.
<em>Ferguson</em> contrary to this finding is rejected.</p>

<p>We conclude that in the field of public education the
doctrine of “separate but equal” has no place. Separate
educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we
hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for
whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the
segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection
of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. This
disposition makes unnecessary any discussion whether such
segregation also violates the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Because these are class actions, because of the wide
applicability of this decision, and because of the great
variety of local conditions, the formulation of decrees in
these cases presents problems of considerable complexity.
On reargument, the consideration of appropriate relief was
necessarily subordinated to the primary question&mdash;the constitutionality
of segregation in public education. We have now
announced that such segregation is a denial of the equal
protection of the laws. In order that we may have the full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
assistance of the parties in formulating decrees, the cases
will be restored to the docket, and the parties are requested
to present further argument on Questions 4 and 5 previously
propounded by the Court for the reargument this Term.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The Attorney General of the United States is again invited to
participate. The Attorneys General of the states requiring or
permitting segregation in public education will also be permitted
to appear as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amici curiae</i> upon request to do so by

</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Mr. Chief Justice Warren</span> delivered the opinion of the
Court.</p>

<p>This case challenges the validity of segregation in the
public schools of the District of Columbia. The petitioners,
minors of the Negro race, allege that such segregation deprives
them of due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.
They were refused admission to a public school attended
by white children solely because of their race. They
sought the aid of the District Court for the District of
Columbia in obtaining admission. That court dismissed their
complaint. The Court granted a writ of certiorari before
judgment in the Court of Appeals because of the importance
of the constitutional question presented. 344 U. S. 873.</p>

<p>We have this day held that the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the states from
maintaining racially segregated public schools.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The legal
problem in the District of Columbia is somewhat different,
however. The Fifth Amendment, which is applicable in the
District of Columbia, does not contain an equal protection
clause as does the Fourteenth Amendment which applies
only to the states. But the concepts of equal protection and
due process, both stemming from our American ideal of
fairness, are not mutually exclusive. The “equal protection
of the laws” is a more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness
than “due process of law,” and, therefore, we do
not imply that the two are always interchangeable phrases.
But, as this Court has recognized, discrimination may be so
unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span></p>

<p>Classifications based solely upon race must be scrutinized
with particular care, since they are contrary to our traditions
and hence constitutionally suspect.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> As long ago as 1896,
this Court declared the principle “that the Constitution of
the United States, in its present form, forbids, so far as
civil and political rights are concerned, discrimination by
the General Government, or by the States, against any
citizen because of his race.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> And in <em>Buchanan</em> v. <em>Warley</em>,
245 U. S. 60, the Court held that a statute which limited
the right of a property owner to convey his property to a
person of another race was, as an unreasonable discrimination,
a denial of due process of law.</p>

<p>Although the Court has not assumed to define “liberty”
with any great precision, that term is not confined to mere
freedom from bodily restraint. Liberty under law extends
to the full range of conduct which the individual is free
to pursue, and it cannot be restricted except for a proper
governmental objective. Segregation in public education is
not reasonably related to any proper governmental objective,
and thus it imposes on Negro children of the District of
Columbia a burden that constitutes an arbitrary deprivation
of their liberty in violation of the Due Process Clause.</p>

<p>In view of our decision that the Constitution prohibits
the states from maintaining racially segregated public schools,
it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would
impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> We hold
that racial segregation in the public schools of the District
of Columbia is a denial of the due process of law guaranteed
by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>

<p class="p1 center">[Supplementary opinion of May 31, 1955]
[349 U. S. 294]</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Mr. Chief Justice Warren</span> delivered the opinion of the
Court.</p>

<p>These cases were decided on May 17, 1954. The opinions
of that date,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> declaring the fundamental principle that racial
discrimination in public education is unconstitutional, are
incorporated herein by reference. All provisions of federal,
state, or local law requiring or permitting such discrimination
must yield to this principle. There remains for consideration
the manner in which relief is to be accorded.</p>

<p>Because these cases arose under different local conditions
and their disposition will involve a variety of local problems,
we requested further argument on the question of relief.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
In view of the nationwide importance of the decision, we
invited the Attorney General of the United States and the
Attorneys General of all states requiring or permitting racial
discrimination in public education to present their views on
that question. The parties, the United States and the States
of Florida, North Carolina, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Maryland,
and Texas filed briefs and participated in the oral
argument.</p>

<p>These presentations were informative and helpful to the
Court in its consideration of the complexities arising from
the transition to a system of public education freed of
racial discrimination. The presentations also demonstrated
that substantial steps to eliminate racial discrimination in
public schools have already been taken, not only in some of
the communities in which these cases arose, but in some of
the states appearing as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amici curiae</i>, and in other states as
well. Substantial progress has been made in the District of
Columbia and in the communities in Kansas and Delaware
involved in this litigation. The defendants in the cases coming
to us from South Carolina and Virginia are awaiting
the decision of this Court concerning relief.</p>

<p>Full implementation of these constitutional principles may
require solution of varied local school problems, School
authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating,
assessing, and solving these problems; courts will have to
consider whether the action of school authorities constitutes
good faith implementation of the governing constitutional
principles. Because of their proximity to local conditions and
the possible need for further hearings, the courts which
originally heard these cases can best perform this judicial
appraisal. Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to remand
the cases to those courts.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In fashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will
be guided by equitable principles. Traditionally, equity has
been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
remedies<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling
public and private needs.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> These cases call for the exercise
of these traditional attributes of equity power. At stake is
the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public
schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory basis.
To effectuate this interest may call for elimination of a
variety of obstacles in making the transition to school systems
operated in accordance with the constitutional principles
set forth in our May 17, 1954, decision. Courts of equity
may properly take into account the public interest in the
elimination of such obstacles in a systematic and effective
manner. But it should go without saying that the vitality of
these constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield
simply because of disagreement with them.</p>

<p>While giving weight to these public and private considerations,
the courts will require that the defendants make
a prompt and reasonable start toward full compliance with
our May 17, 1954, ruling. Once such a start has been made,
the courts may find that additional time is necessary to
carry out the ruling in an effective manner. The burden
rests upon the defendants to establish that such time is
necessary in the public interest and is consistent with good
faith compliance at the earliest practicable date. To that
end, the courts may consider problems related to administration,
arising from the physical condition of the school plant,
the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school
districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve
a system of determining admission to the public schools on
a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations
which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems.
They will also consider the adequacy of any plans the defendants
may propose to meet these problems and to effectuate
a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system.
During this period of transition, the courts will retain jurisdiction
of these cases.</p>

<p>The judgments below, except that in the Delaware case,
are accordingly reversed and the cases are remanded to the
District Courts to take such proceedings and enter such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
orders and decrees consistent with this opinion as are necessary
and proper to admit to public schools on a racially
nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed the parties
to these cases. The judgment in the Delaware case&mdash;ordering
the immediate admission of the plaintiffs to schools previously
attended only by white children&mdash;is affirmed on the
basis of the principles stated in our May 17, 1954, opinion,
but the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Delaware
for such further proceedings as that Court may deem necessary
in light of this opinion.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">There stands in the Grove of Academe, or so I have often
imagined, a certain idolatrous image. It is a crane-like
creature with italic wings, the great god <em>Ibid.</em>, and before
it, strutting on their tiny six-point feet, the pedant peacocks
daily make obeisance. They look up, <em>supra</em>, and down <em>infra</em>,
and spreading their tails with asterisk eyes, they march with
robed scholars to lay garlands of <em>op. cit.</em> upon the ritual
shrine.</p>

<p>When I launched into this book, I swore a blasphemous
oath upon such phony veneration. After a long life of reading
footnotes, and reading them religiously, I have concluded
that 98.2 per cent of them are so much flummery: They are
showin’ off befo’ God. Thus I had not planned upon notes
or bibliography, and this extended note is afterthought; it
is the reluctant consequence of listening to beguiling editors.
They said: Where did you get all this stuff? Whence these
bizarre ideas? They said: Serious students will want to know
where to get supporting material intended to prove (a) that
you are a fraud, or (b) that there may be something to
the Southern position after all. You ought to gird up your
Gothic archness with a few flying buttresses of attribution.
And in a moment of weakness, I said very well.</p>

<p>The figures on population, area, wages, housing, and the
like, in the opening pages of this book, come primarily from
the 1960 Census and the <cite>Statistical Abstract of the United
States for 1961</cite>. The Census people have a diabolical genius
for presenting their data in the least usable possible form,
but they have a monopoly on the figures and no other source
exists.</p>

<p>As for the nature of the South: Almost every Southerner
who writes for a living at one time or another has wooed
this elusive theme. I would suggest that a student start with
W. J. Cash’s <cite>The Mind of the South</cite>, not because I agree
with everything Cash had to say, but because his brief star
flashed with a rare brilliance across the Southern sky. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
Knopf edition of 1941 is now available in a Doubleday
Anchor paperback, and though parts of it are dated, it continues
to offer a good basic foundation. Then, at random,
William Alexander Percy’s <cite>Lanterns on the Levee</cite>, and David
Cohn’s <cite>Where I Was Born and Raised</cite>. The late William
Polk of Greensboro, N.C., was a delightful gentleman; during
an editorial writers’ convention in Boston, we once talked
of the South’s problems between the bumps and grinds of
an Old Howard Burly-Q. His book, <cite>Southern Accent</cite> (1953)
is fine background reading. Although they are hard to find,
Ward Allison Dorrance’s several books on Southern rivers
are worth the effort. Some good essays appear in <cite>The Lasting
South</cite> (1957), a collection edited largely by Louis D. Rubin,
Jr., though my own name is on the spine too.</p>

<p>A great many other books about the South come to mind.
Henry Grady’s <cite>The New South</cite>, published in 1890, is almost
indispensable. Another necessary work, of seminal influence,
is the Agrarians’ <cite>I’ll Take My Stand</cite> of 1930. I come back
frequently to Matthew Page Andrews’ <cite>Virginia, The Old
Dominion</cite>. C. Vann Woodward’s several books are useful:
<cite>The Burden of Southern History</cite>, <cite>Origins of the New South</cite>,
and <cite>The Strange Career of Jim Crow</cite>. The serious student’s
reading list would find a place for <cite>Seeds of Time</cite>, by Henry
Savage, Jr.; <cite>Southern Tradition and Regional Progress</cite>, by
William H. Nicholls; <cite>The Southern Heritage</cite>, by James McBride
Dabbs, and <cite>Goodbye to Uncle Tom</cite>, by J. C. Furnas.
Thomas D. Clark’s <cite>The Emerging South</cite> is good on economic
history. Virginius Dabney’s <cite>Below the Potomac</cite>, published
in 1942, remains a solid work. Bernard Robb’s <cite>Welcum
Hinges</cite> is at once gentle and delightful. The student should
not pass by Harry Ashmore’s <cite>Epitaph for Dixie</cite> (1958) and
<cite>The Other Side of Jordan</cite> (1960). And of course, before it
gets overlooked by reason of its bulk and importance, the
multi-volumed history of the South emerging from Louisiana
State University Press is a primary reference.</p>

<p>Many of the foregoing titles&mdash;alas, almost all of them&mdash;are
the work of Southern Liberals. And I do not seem to
have mentioned P. D. East’s <cite>The Magnolia Jungle</cite>, or Hodding
Carter’s <cite>Southern Legacy</cite> and <cite>Where the Main Street
Meets the River</cite>, and <cite>The South Strikes Back</cite>, or Robert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Penn Warren’s <cite>Segregation</cite>, or Jonathan Daniels’ <cite>A Southerner
Discovers the South</cite> and <cite>Frontier on the Potomac</cite>. Nearly
all the recent crop of books are cast in molds more liberal
yet: Carl T. Rowan’s <cite>Go South to Sorrow</cite>; John Howard
Griffin’s <cite>Black Like Me</cite>, and Richard Wright’s <cite>White Man,
Listen!</cite> Wilma Dykeman and James Stokely have co-authored
two books worth serious thought: <cite>Neither Black nor White</cite>,
and <cite>Seeds of Southern Change</cite>. A student’s shelf should
leave a place for William Peters’ <cite>The Southern Temper</cite>.
Several books of largely contemporary, topical interest should
be read: Martin Luther King’s account of the Montgomery
boycott, <cite>Stride Toward Freedom</cite>; Bishop Robert R. Brown’s
<cite>Bigger Than Little Rock</cite>; Virgil T. Blossom’s <cite>It Has Happened
Here</cite>; and John Bartlow Martin’s generally well-balanced
<cite>The Deep South Says Never</cite>. Martin’s book is the work
of a professional reporter. Most of the rest of the books
mentioned in this paragraph annoyed the hell out of me.</p>

<p>Against this monstrous amount of sack, one finds but a
penny’s worth of bread. The conservative South has not
lacked willing spokesmen; it has lacked agreeable publishers.
A bare handful of works present a contrary view, and some
of these&mdash;Herman Talmadge’s <cite>You and Segregation</cite>, and
W. E. Debnam’s impudent <cite>Weep No More, My Lady</cite>, and
<cite>My Old Kentucky Home, Good Night</cite>&mdash;are in paperback.
The scant list of hardcover works espousing the point of view
of several million white Southerners includes only Bill Workman’s
<cite>The Case for the South</cite> (1960), Carleton Putnam’s
<cite>Race and Reason, a Yankee View</cite>, and my own <cite>The Sovereign
States</cite> (1957), a book I still like very much. (There is
also Charles P. Bloch’s lawyerly <cite>States Rights: The Law of
the Land</cite>, but that probably should be mentioned later in
books on legal aspects of the question.)</p>

<p>One scarcely knows where to begin on books dealing with
the Negro as such. The literature in this field is unending.
In fairness, the student should seek out a couple of books
that advance the traditional Southern view: Earnest Sevier
Cox’s <cite>White America</cite> (1923) and, from as far back as
1910, E. H. Randle’s slim <cite>Characteristics of the Southern
Negro</cite>. In the same year that Randle wrote his book, an
English critic, William Archer, brought forth <cite>Through Afro-America</cite>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
These three works are period pieces now, but they
still have value.</p>

<p>I have relied heavily in writing this book on Nathaniel
Weyl’s <cite>The Negro in American Civilization</cite>. Needless to say,
a hundred other works are arrayed against his point of view.
The student doubtless will have to begin with almost anything
from W. E. B. DuBois, keeping in mind that DuBois,
the grand old Red of the NAACP, formally joined the Communist
Party in 1961. His works are important, nonetheless.
Jerome Dowd’s <cite>The Negro in American Life</cite> (1926) is long,
and outdated, but still most useful. A thoughtful reader will
find a few hours for Tuskegee’s Robert R. Moton; his autobiography
of 1920, <cite>Finding a Way Out</cite>, even then predicted
a day when the white South would “stop feeling and begin
thinking” about its Negro problem, and his <cite>What the Negro
Thinks</cite> (1929) offers an insight into the continuing nature
of Negro goals. A more militant work by the NAACP’s James
Weldon Johnson, <cite>Negro Americans, What Now?</cite> appeared
in 1934. And thinking of the NAACP, Mary White Ovington’s
<cite>The Walls Came Tumbling Down</cite> (1947) contains
some material not available elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of more recent vintage, half a dozen studies of the Negro
deserve mention as reference works. Primus, of course, the
monumental (and monumentally unreadable) work of Gunnar
Myrdal and his associates, <cite>An American Dilemma</cite>. There
are said to be eleven persons in the United States, apart from
the collaborators, who have read the whole two volumes; I
am not among them. But I ploughed through most of it.
Arnold Rose, Myrdal’s chief assistant, has brought out a
condensation, published in 1948 as <cite>The Negro in America</cite>.
Rayford W. Logan of Howard University, one of the most
prolific writers in the field, has produced a number of works
of substantial value, among them <cite>The Negro in American
Life and Thought</cite> and <cite>The Negro in the Postwar World</cite>. His
colleague, Edward Franklin Frazier, also has published extensively;
his <cite>The Negro in the United States</cite> (1957) is quite
useful. Still another Negro writer, Arna Werdell Bontemps,
should be consulted through her <cite>100 Years of Negro Freedom</cite>.
An interesting work that I came across after this manuscript<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
was finished is Gilbert Franklin Edwards’ <cite>The Negro
Professional Class</cite> (1959).</p>

<p>In the narrower field of political action, the general reader
should begin with V. O. Key’s major work, <cite>Southern Politics
in State and Nation</cite>, which sets the scene, and then go back to
William Felbert Nowlin’s work of 1931, <cite>The Negro in American
National Politics</cite>. A good contemporary work is <cite>The
Negro and Southern Politics</cite>, by Hugh Douglas White. Of
less value, in part because of its arrogant tone, is Henry
Lee Moon’s polemical <cite>Balance of Power: The Negro Vote</cite>
(a typical reference is to the “political zombies who infest
the sub-Potomac region”). Report of the Civil Rights Commission
and the Southern Regional Council are indispensable.</p>

<p>For the absolute amateur, coming cold into the field
of anthropology, E. E. Evans-Pritchard’s BBC lectures,
<cite>Social Anthropology</cite>, offer a most congenial introduction.
This should be followed, I suggest, by Alfred Louis Kroeber’s
<cite>Anthropology</cite>, originally published in 1923 and updated in
1948. It is hard work. Then, in a hard-driving rush: Ralph
Linton’s <cite>The Tree of Culture</cite>, Carleton S. Coon’s <cite>The Story
of Man</cite>, Hooton’s <cite>Apes, Men and Morons</cite> and <cite>Up from the
Ape</cite>, Clyde Kluckhohn’s <cite>Mirror for Man</cite>; almost anything
by Toynbee and Breasted; and warming to the more immediate
theme, Franz Boas’ <cite>Anthropology and Modern Life</cite>
(1928) and his <cite>Race, Language and Culture</cite> (1940). Boas
was the great-granddaddy of the whole Liberal movement in
social anthropology; he influenced a generation or more of
dutiful followers. Melville Herskovits, of Northwestern,
has written (1943) an agreeable biography of him. It merits
a reading. And so do Herskovits’ own works, <cite>The American
Negro</cite> (1928) and his more definitive <cite>The Myth of the
Negro Past</cite> (1958). Otto Klineberg’s works are important:
<cite>Negro Intelligence and Selective Migration</cite> (1935) and the
useful anthology, <cite>Characteristics of the American Negro</cite>
(1944). The famous UNESCO pamphlet on race has been
covered in the text; Ruth Benedict and Gene Weltfish belong
in a footnote. A very small footnote. Ashley Montagu, a
monstrously irritating man, has to be read, or at least
scratched: <cite>Man: His First Million Years</cite>, <cite>Human Heredity</cite>,
and <cite>Man in Process</cite>. This last work I fetched home only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
week ago. I do not like Ashley Montagu. Langston Hughes’
<cite>African Treasury</cite> is about what you would imagine Hughes
would put out. Better, on African background, are John
Coleman De Graft-Johnson’s <cite>African Glory: The Story of
Vanished Negro Civilizations</cite> (1955) and Maurice Delafosse’s
<cite>The Negroes of Africa</cite> (1931). But the bibliography in this
area is extensive, and it grows more rapturous all the time.
<cite>The African Colonization Movement</cite>, by P. J. Staudenraus
(1961) is as good a roundup of this early nineteenth-century
movement as I have come across.</p>

<p>In the text, I have called attention to Dr. Audrey M.
Shuey’s <cite>Testing of Negro Intelligence</cite>. Let me call repeated
attention to it here. This is an indispensable reference work,
of unimpeachable integrity, for any student who proposes
seriously to investigate Negro scores on intelligence tests. The
student also should seek out Dr. Henry E. Garrett’s <cite>Great
Experiments in Psychology</cite> (1951), and he should get his
subscription in to <cite>Mankind Quarterly</cite>, 1 Darnaway St., Edinburgh
3, Scotland. At the University of Chicago, Dr. Dwight
J. Ingle has demonstrated a fierce and wonderful courage in
admitting unorthodox views to his <cite>Perspectives in Biology
and Medicine</cite>, in which Dr. Montagu has been recently
skewered.</p>

<p>This gets me, by hop, skip and jump, to reference works
in the area of Constitutional history, law, and contemporary
politics. The <cite>Federalist</cite>, of course. Elliot’s <cite>Debates</cite>. Madison’s
<cite>Notes</cite>. Tocqueville. Jefferson’s Letters. Madison. There is no
stopping point. The biographies of Marshall and Washington.
James Morton Smith’s <cite>Freedom’s Fetters</cite>. Bibliography is
futile. The student of the Constitution will read a thousand
works, and then read a thousand more. He shouldn’t miss
Charles Warren’s <cite>The Supreme Court in U.S. History</cite>. Yale’s
Fred Rodell is a derisive fellow; his <cite>Nine Men</cite> is a fine, extended
raspberry cheer, but it should be read. Most of the
members of the Court have been loquacious; they cannot
keep their tongues tied down. The law reviews fairly bulge
with important material. Robert B. McKay’s long essay in
the <cite>New York University Law Review</cite> (June, 1956) is no
help to my position, but it merits a reading. Basic source
material, of course, is available through the indispensable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
<cite>Race Relations Law Reporter</cite>. The student interested in getting
both sides of this dispute should look up Senator Eastland’s
“Era of Judicial Tyranny,” available through the
Citizens Council, and Alfred J. Schweppe’s article in the
American Bar Association’s <cite>Journal</cite> of February, 1958,
“Enforcement of Federal Court Decrees.” On the question
of private schools, a biased and snippy book by Donald
Ross and Warren E. Gauerke, <cite>If the Schools Are Closed</cite>,
merits a reading. The two Emory professors are anti-private
school, but the source material is there. I have already
mentioned Charles J. Bloch’s <cite>States Rights: The Law of the
Land</cite>; it is a first-rate piece of work.</p>

<p>On the Fourteenth Amendment: Joseph B. James’ work
is basic, <cite>The Framing of the Fourteenth Amendment</cite> (1956).
See also Walter J. Suthon’s article in the <cite>Tulane Law Review</cite>
at December, 1953, “The Dubious Origin of the Fourteenth
Amendment”; Horace E. Flack’s “The Adoption of the
Fourteenth Amendment,” in <cite>John Hopkins Studies</cite> (1908),
and Joseph F. Ingham’s “Unconstitutional Amendments,” in
the <cite>Dickinson Law Review</cite> of March, 1929, among many
other sources.</p>

<p>It is futile to attempt any bibliographical note on the
specific subject of school desegregation since 1954. The
library of the Southern Educational Reporting Service in
Nashville <ins class="corr" id="tn-219" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'is a stonehouse'">
is a storehouse</ins> of material to be found nowhere
else. I am indebted to Reed Sarratt and his associates there
for making its riches available to me. Don Shoemaker’s
<cite>With All Deliberate Speed</cite>; Harry Ashmore’s <cite>The Negro and
the Schools</cite>; and <cite>Public Education in the South Today and
Tomorrow</cite>, by Ernst W. Swanson and John A. Griffin (1955),
are basic references. Any serious study must take in the annual
reports of the various Southern State superintendents
of public education. Bill Simmons, the urbane and immensely
attractive executive director of the Citizens Council
in Jackson, Miss., has a wealth of material available; student
debaters who get stuck with the Southern side of the
question should not hesitate to write him at the Plaza Building
in Jackson.</p>

<p>This is about all the bibliography I am up to. Any student
who delves into this subject necessarily will resort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
immediately to the Periodical Index. It teems with magazine
references. Offhand, I know of not more than a dozen
articles that present some aspects of the traditional Southern
view&mdash;this, out of <em>more than two thousand</em> indexed articles
supporting the integrationist view since 1954. Look them
up: Clifford Dowdey, in <cite>Saturday Review</cite> of Oct. 9, 1954;
Senator Ervin, in <cite>Look</cite> of April 3, 1956; Herbert Ravebel
Sass, in <cite>Atlantic</cite> of November 1956; Tom Waring, in <cite>Harper’s</cite>,
January 1956; Virginius Dabney, in <cite>Life</cite> of Sept. 22,
1958; William F. Buckley, Jr., in <cite>Saturday Review</cite> of Nov.
11, 1961; Perry Morgan, in <cite>Esquire</cite> for January, 1962;
Donald R. Davidson in the <cite>Star Weekly Magazine</cite> for Nov.
9, 1957. There may have been a few others. The Citizens
Council has a wealth of pamphlets, booklets, and other
ephemera available to the student who troubles to ask for
reference material. And of course the microfilmed resources
of the Southern Educational Reporting Service are invaluable.</p>

<p>I owe thanks to my right arm, Ann Lloyd Merriman; and
to my publisher in Richmond, D. Tennant Bryan; and to
the librarians of the State Law Library, the Library of Congress,
and the state and city libraries in Richmond; to my
congenial masters at Collier Books; to Dr. Henry E. Garrett;
to John Riely, attorney, who made available to me the
briefs of all parties in the School Segregation Cases; to
various antagonists of the NAACP, among them Thurgood
Marshall and Spotswood Robinson III. And the day this
book appears, in glancing over this incomplete and sketchy
note, I will think of a hundred other sources and mentors

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> In the Kansas case, <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, the plaintiffs
are Negro children of elementary-school age residing in Topeka.
They brought this action in the United States District Court for
the District of Kansas to enjoin enforcement of a Kansas statute
which permits, but does not require, cities of more than 15,000
population to maintain separate school facilities for Negro and
white students. Kan. Gen. Stat. § 72-1724 (1949). Pursuant to
that authority, the Topeka Board of Education elected to establish
segregated elementary schools. Other public schools in the community,
however, are operated on a nonsegregated basis. The
three-judge District Court, convened under 28 U. S. C. §§ 2281
and 2284, found that segregation in public education has a detrimental
effect upon Negro children, but denied relief on the
ground that the Negro and white schools were substantially
equal with respect to buildings, transportation, curricula, and
educational qualifications of teachers. 98 F. Supp. 797. The case
is here on direct appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1253.</p>

<p>In the South Carolina case, <em>Briggs</em> v. <em>Elliott</em>, the plaintiffs are
Negro children of both elementary and high school age residing
in Clarendon County. They brought this action in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina
to enjoin enforcement of provisions in the state constitution and
statutory code which require the segregation of Negroes and
whites in public schools. S. C. Const., Art. XI, § 7; S. C. Code
§ 5377 (1942). The three-judge District Court, convened under
28 U. S. C. §§ 2281 and 2284, denied the requested relief. The
court found that the Negro schools were inferior to the white
schools and ordered the defendants to begin immediately to
equalize the facilities. But the court sustained the validity of the
contested provisions and denied the plaintiffs admission to the
white schools during the equalization program. 98 F. Supp. 529.
This Court vacated the District Court’s judgment and remanded
the case for the purpose of obtaining the court’s views on a
report filed by the defendants concerning the progress made in
the equalization program. 342 U. S. 350. On remand, the District
Court found that substantial equality had been achieved
except for buildings and that the defendants were proceeding to
rectify this inequality as well. 103 F. Supp. 920. The case is
again here on direct appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1253.</p>

<p>In the Virginia case, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>County School Board</em>, the plaintiffs
are Negro children of high school age residing in Prince Edward
County. They brought this action in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to enjoin enforcement
of provisions in the state constitution and statutory code which
require the segregation of Negroes and whites in public schools.
Va. Const., § 140; Va. Code § 22-221 (1950). The three-judge
District Court, convened under 28 U. S. C. §§ 2281 and 2284,
denied the requested relief. The court found the Negro school
inferior in physical plant, curricula, and transportation, and
ordered the defendants forthwith to provide substantially equal
curricula and transportation and to “proceed with all reasonable
diligence and dispatch to remove” the inequality in physical plant.
But, as in the South Carolina case, the court sustained the
validity of the contested provisions and denied the plaintiffs admission
to the white schools during the equalization program.
103 F. Supp. 337. The case is here on direct appeal under
28 U. S. C. § 1253.</p>

<p>In the Delaware case, <em>Gebhart</em> v. <em>Belton</em>, the plaintiffs are Negro
children of both elementary and high school age residing in New
Castle County. They brought this action in the Delaware Court
of Chancery to enjoin enforcement of provisions in the state
constitution and statutory code which require the segregation of
Negroes and whites in public schools. Del. Const., Art. X, § 2;
Del. Rev. Code § 2631 (1935). The Chancellor gave judgment
for the plaintiffs and ordered their immediate admission to schools
previously attended only by white children, on the ground that
the Negro schools were inferior with respect to teacher training,
pupil-teacher ratio, extracurricular activities, physical plant, and
time and distance involved in travel. 87 A. 2d 862. The Chancellor
also found that segregation itself results in an inferior education
for Negro children (see <a href="#Footnote_11">note 10</a>, <em>infra</em>,), but did not rest his
decision on that ground. <em>Id.</em>, at 865. The Chancellor’s decree was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Delaware, which intimated,
however, that the defendants might be able to obtain a modification
of the decree after equalization of the Negro and white
schools had been accomplished. 91 A. 2d 137, 152. The defendants,
contending only that the Delaware courts had erred in
ordering the immediate admission of the Negro plaintiffs to the
white schools, applied to this Court for certiorari. The writ was
granted, 344 U. S. 891. The plaintiffs, who were successful below,
did not submit a cross-petition.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> For a general study of the development of public education
prior to the Amendment, see Butts and Cremin, A History of
Education in American Culture (1953), Pts. I, II; Cubberley,
Public Education in the United States (1934 ed.), cc. II-XII.
School practices current at the time of the adoption of the
Fourteenth Amendment are described in Butts and Cremin, supra,
at 269-275; Cubberley, <em>supra</em>, at 288-339, 408-431; Knight,
Public Education in the South (1922), cc. VIII, IX. See also
H. Ex. Doc. No. 315, 41st Cong., 2d Sess. (1871). Although
the demand for free public schools followed substantially the
same pattern in both the North and the South, the development
in the South did not begin to gain momentum until about 1850,
some twenty years after that in the North. The reasons for the
somewhat slower development in the South (<em>e.g.</em>, the rural
character of the South and the different regional attitudes toward
state assistance) are well explained in Cubberley, <em>supra</em>, at
408-423. In the country as a whole, but particularly in the
South, the War virtually stopped all progress in public education.
<em>Id.</em>, at 427-428. The low status of Negro education in all sections
of the country, both before and immediately after the War, is
described in Beale, A History of Freedom of Teaching in
American Schools (1941), 112-132, 175-195. Compulsory school
attendance laws were not generally adopted until after the
ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and it was not until
1918 that such laws were in force in all the states. Cubberley,
<em>supra</em>, at 563-565.</p>

<em>West Virginia</em>, 100 U. S. 303, 307-308 (1880):</p>

<p>“It ordains that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law, or deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. What is
this but declaring that the law in the States shall be the same
for the black as for the white; that all persons, whether colored
or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the States, and, in
regard to the colored race, for whose protection the amendment
was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall be made
against them by law because of their color? The words of the
amendment, it is true, are prohibitory, but they contain a necessary
implication of a positive immunity, or right, most valuable
to the colored race,&mdash;the right to exemption from unfriendly
legislation against them distinctively as colored,&mdash;exemption from
legal discriminations, implying inferiority in civil society, lessening
the security of their enjoyment of the rights which others enjoy,
and discriminations which are steps towards reducing them to
the condition of a subject race.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The doctrine apparently originated in <em>Roberts</em> v. <em>City of Boston</em>,
59 Mass. 198, 206 (1850), upholding school segregation against
attack as being violative of a state constitutional guarantee of
equality. Segregation in Boston public schools was eliminated
in 1855. Mass. Acts 1855, c. 256. But elsewhere in the North
segregation in public education has persisted in some communities
until recent years. It is apparent that such segregation has long
been a nationwide problem, not merely one of sectional concern.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> In the <em>Cumming</em> case, Negro taxpayers sought an injunction requiring
the defendant school board to discontinue the operation
of a high school for white children until the board resumed
operation of a high school for Negro children. Similarly, in the
<em>Gong Lum</em> case, the plaintiff, a child of Chinese descent, contended
only that state authorities had misapplied the doctrine by
classifying him with Negro children and requiring him to attend
a Negro school.</p>

Carolina case, the court below found that the defendants were
proceeding “promptly and in good faith to comply with the
court’s decree.” 103 F. Supp. 920, 921. In the Virginia case, the
court below noted that the equalization program was already
“afoot and progressing” (103 F. Supp. 337, 341); since
then, we have been advised, in the Virginia Attorney General’s
brief on reargument, that the program has now been completed.
In the Delaware case, the court below similarly noted that the

situated.” 87 A. 2d 862, 865.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
